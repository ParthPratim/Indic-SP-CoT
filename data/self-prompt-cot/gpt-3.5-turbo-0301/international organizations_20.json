A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was created following the Second World War to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the UN is in Manhattan, New York City, and is subject to extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. The UN is the largest, most familiar, most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world. In 2020, the UN had 193 member states and two observer states, namely the Holy See and Palestine. Some member states have additional offices bilaterally accredited to the United Nations Office at Geneva or Vienna. The organization is composed of various bodies, including the General Assembly, Security Council, Economic and Social Council, International Court of Justice, and the UN Secretariat. The UN System includes a multitude of specialized agencies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the World Food Programme (WFP). The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success. The organization's membership grew significantly in the 21st century, particularly in Africa and Asia, with new members admitted as recently as 2011.",

The WHO Constitution, which establishes the agency's governing structure and principles, was adopted on April 7, 1948, and came into force on April 7, 1948, the same day as the first World Health Day. The WHO's headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland, and it has six regional offices worldwide. The WHO's primary objective is to promote the attainment of the highest possible level of health for all people. It does this by providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring and assessing health trends. The WHO's work is guided by the Global Programme of Work, which sets out the strategic priorities for the organization. The current programme covers the period 2019-2023 and focuses on three strategic priorities: achieving universal health coverage, addressing health emergencies, and promoting healthier populations. Achieving universal health coverage is a key priority for the WHO. The organization believes that everyone should have access to quality health services without suffering financial hardship. To achieve this goal, the WHO works with countries to develop and implement policies and strategies that ensure that health services are accessible, affordable, and of high quality. Addressing health emergencies is another important priority for the WHO. The organization plays a critical role in responding to outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as Ebola and Zika, and in providing support to countries affected by natural disasters and other emergencies. Promoting healthier populations is the third strategic priority for the WHO. The organization works to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, and to promote healthy lifestyles, such as physical activity and healthy eating. The WHO is also responsible for coordinating international health efforts and for providing technical assistance to countries. It works closely with other United Nations agencies, such as UNICEF and the World Food Programme, as well as with non-governmental organizations and other partners. In addition to its core functions, the WHO also plays a key role in setting global health standards and in promoting research and innovation in the field of public health. The organization is responsible for developing and updating the International Classification of Diseases, which is used by health professionals around the world to diagnose and classify diseases. Overall, the WHO is a critical player in the global health landscape, working to promote health and well-being for all people, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status.",

It was established on January 1, 1995, as a successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which had been in existence since 1948. The WTO is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and has 164 member countries as of 2021. The primary objective of the WTO is to promote free trade by reducing barriers to international trade, such as tariffs, quotas, and other trade restrictions. The organization also provides a forum for member countries to negotiate and resolve trade disputes. The WTO operates on the principle of non-discrimination, which means that member countries must treat all other member countries equally in terms of trade. The WTO has a number of key functions, including the negotiation of trade agreements, the monitoring of member countries' trade policies, and the provision of technical assistance and training to developing countries. The organization also provides a platform for member countries to discuss and address issues related to trade and development. One of the most important functions of the WTO is the negotiation of trade agreements. These agreements are designed to reduce trade barriers and promote free trade between member countries. The most significant of these agreements is the Agreement on Agriculture, which was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations and has had a major impact on global agricultural trade. The WTO also plays a key role in monitoring member countries' trade policies. This involves reviewing member countries' trade policies and practices to ensure that they are consistent with WTO rules and regulations. The organization also provides technical assistance and training to developing countries to help them build their capacity to participate in the global trading system. In addition to its core functions, the WTO also provides a forum for member countries to discuss and address issues related to trade and development. This includes issues such as intellectual property rights, environmental protection, and labor standards. Despite its many achievements, the WTO has faced criticism from some quarters. Critics argue that the organization is too focused on promoting free trade at the expense of other important social and environmental goals. Others argue that the WTO is too dominated by developed countries and does not do enough to address the needs of developing countries. Despite these criticisms, the WTO remains an important institution in the global trading system. Its role in promoting free trade and resolving trade disputes has helped to create a more open and predictable trading environment, which has benefited businesses and consumers around the world.",

The World Bank is a component of the World Bank Group. The World Bank's stated goal is the reduction of poverty. According to its Articles of Agreement, all its decisions must be guided by a commitment to promote foreign investment, international trade, and facilitate capital investment. The World Bank differs from the World Bank Group, in that the World Bank comprises only the IBRD and the IDA, whereas the latter incorporates these two in addition to three more: International Finance Corporation (IFC), Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The World Bank was created at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The president of the World Bank is, traditionally, an American. The World Bank and the IMF are both based in Washington, D.C., and work closely with each other. Although many countries were represented at the Bretton Woods Conference, the United States and United Kingdom were the most powerful in attendance and dominated the negotiations. The intention behind the founding of the World Bank was to provide long-term financing to rebuild Europe after World War II. The original mission of the World Bank was to provide loans for the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. However, the Bank's mission has evolved to encompass the elimination of poverty by promoting economic growth, reducing inequalities, and improving people's living standards. The World Bank has a wide range of activities, including lending, policy advice, technical assistance, and knowledge sharing. Its lending operations are primarily focused on developing countries, with a particular emphasis on the poorest and most vulnerable countries. The Bank provides loans for a variety of purposes, including infrastructure development, education, health, and social services. The World Bank has been criticized for its policies and practices. Critics argue that the Bank's lending policies have often been harmful to the environment, and that its focus on economic growth has come at the expense of social and environmental concerns. The Bank has also been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, and for its close ties to the United States government. Despite these criticisms, the World Bank remains an important player in the global economy. Its lending operations have helped to finance many important development projects, and its policy advice and technical assistance have been instrumental in shaping economic policy in many developing countries.",

The ICC was created by the Rome Statute, which entered into force on July 1, 2002. The Rome Statute is a multilateral treaty which serves as the ICC's foundational and governing document. States which become party to the Rome Statute, for example by ratifying it, become members of the ICC. Currently, there are 123 states which are party to the Rome Statute and therefore members of the ICC. The ICC is the first and only permanent international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The ICC is an independent international organization, and is not part of the United Nations system. However, the ICC may cooperate with the United Nations and its organs, and it has a relationship agreement with the United Nations. The ICC is also supported by a number of international and non-governmental organizations. The ICC is composed of four main organs: the Presidency, the Judicial Divisions, the Office of the Prosecutor, and the Registry. The Presidency is responsible for the overall administration of the ICC, and is composed of the President and two Vice-Presidents. The Judicial Divisions are responsible for the judicial work of the ICC, and are composed of the Appeals Division, the Trial Division, and the Pre-Trial Division. The Office of the Prosecutor is responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC, and is headed by the Prosecutor. The Registry is responsible for the non-judicial aspects of the ICC's work, and is headed by the Registrar. The ICC has jurisdiction over individuals, not states. The ICC may only exercise its jurisdiction when the crimes in question have been committed on the territory of a state party to the Rome Statute, or by a national of a state party, or when the United Nations Security Council refers a situation to the ICC. The ICC may also exercise its jurisdiction when a state party refers a situation to the ICC, or when the Prosecutor initiates an investigation proprio motu (on his or her own initiative). The ICC has faced criticism from some quarters.",

The organization implements the North Atlantic Treaty that was signed on 4 April 1949. NATO constitutes a system of collective defense whereby its independent member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, while the headquarters of Allied Command Operations is near Mons, Belgium. Since its founding, NATO has been a cornerstone of transatlantic security and has been instrumental in maintaining peace and stability in the North Atlantic area. NATO has played a key role in the resolution of conflicts in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Libya, and has also contributed to the fight against terrorism. The organization has also been involved in humanitarian and disaster relief operations, such as the earthquake in Turkey in 1999 and the tsunami in Southeast Asia in 2004. NATO's military capabilities are based on its member countries' defense budgets, which are among the largest in the world. The organization's military structure is divided into two strategic commands: Allied Command Operations (ACO) and Allied Command Transformation (ACT). ACO is responsible for the operational planning and execution of NATO missions, while ACT is responsible for the development of NATO's military capabilities. NATO's political structure is based on the North Atlantic Council (NAC), which is the organization's highest decision-making body. The NAC is composed of the ambassadors of the member countries and meets at least once a week. The organization's military structure is headed by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), who is responsible for the overall conduct of military operations. NATO's membership has expanded since its founding, with the addition of new member countries in Europe and North America. The organization's expansion has been controversial, with some critics arguing that it has contributed to tensions with Russia. However, NATO has maintained that its expansion is necessary for the defense of its member countries and for the maintenance of peace and stability in the region. Overall, NATO remains a key player in international security and continues to adapt to new challenges and threats. The organization's commitment to collective defense and its ability to respond to crises has made it an important force for peace and stability in the North Atlantic area.",

The movement consists of several distinct organizations that are legally independent from each other, but are united within the movement through common basic principles, objectives, symbols, statutes and governing institutions. The movement's main components are:\n\n- The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a private humanitarian organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, which has a special mandate under international law to protect the victims of armed conflicts and other situations of violence, and to promote respect for international humanitarian law. - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), a global network of national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, which provides humanitarian assistance and support to vulnerable communities affected by disasters and crises, and promotes community resilience and preparedness. - The National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which are independent humanitarian organizations that are recognized by their respective governments and are affiliated to the IFRC. They provide a wide range of services and activities at the local, national and international levels, including disaster response, health and social care, blood donation, first aid, youth and volunteer programs, and promotion of humanitarian values and principles. The movement's origins can be traced back to the mid-19th century, when Henry Dunant, a Swiss businessman, witnessed the suffering of wounded soldiers during the Battle of Solferino in Italy in 1859. He was inspired to write a book, \"A Memory of Solferino\", in which he proposed the creation of volunteer groups to care for the wounded on the battlefield, regardless of their nationality. This led to the establishment of the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded, which later became the ICRC. The movement's emblem, the red cross on a white background, was adopted in 1864 as a symbol of protection and neutrality for medical personnel and facilities during armed conflicts. Later, the red crescent and the red crystal were also recognized as alternative emblems for countries that objected to the use of the cross for religious or cultural reasons. The movement has played a major role in responding to some of the world's most devastating humanitarian crises, including World War I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Rwandan genocide, the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Haiti earthquake, the Syrian refugee crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In 1971, a group of activists sailed a small boat into the testing zone and attempted to disrupt the tests. This action led to the formation of Greenpeace and the organization's first campaign. Greenpeace has also been involved in campaigns to protect endangered species, such as whales and seals. The organization has used direct action tactics, such as boarding whaling ships and placing themselves between hunters and their prey, to draw attention to the issue. In recent years, Greenpeace has focused on the issue of climate change. The organization has called for a transition to renewable energy sources and has campaigned against the use of fossil fuels. Greenpeace has also been involved in campaigns to protect forests and promote sustainable agriculture. Greenpeace has been criticized by some for its use of direct action tactics, which some see as confrontational and disruptive. However, the organization maintains that nonviolent civil disobedience is necessary to draw attention to environmental issues and to bring about change. Despite the criticism, Greenpeace has had a significant impact on environmental policy and has helped to raise awareness about environmental issues around the world. The organization's campaigns have led to the creation of protected areas, the banning of harmful chemicals, and the adoption of renewable energy policies.",

One of Amnesty International's most well-known campaigns is the annual Write for Rights campaign, which encourages people around the world to write letters of support to prisoners of conscience and human rights defenders who are facing persecution. The campaign has been successful in securing the release of many prisoners and in raising awareness about human rights abuses. Amnesty International has been recognized for its work with numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977.

It was established in June 1945 by the Charter of the United Nations and began work in April 1946. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges elected by the UN General Assembly and the Security Council for nine-year terms. The court is located in The Hague, Netherlands, and its official languages are English and French. The ICJ has two main functions: to settle legal disputes between states and to provide advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by UN organs and specialized agencies. The court's jurisdiction is limited to cases where both parties have consented to its jurisdiction, either by treaty or by special agreement. The ICJ has jurisdiction over a wide range of legal issues, including territorial disputes, maritime boundaries, human rights, international law, and the interpretation of treaties. The ICJ's decisions are binding and final, and there is no appeal from its judgments. The court's decisions are enforced by the UN Security Council, which has the power to take measures to ensure compliance with the court's rulings. The ICJ has played a significant role in the development of international law, particularly in the areas of human rights, environmental law, and the law of the sea. The ICJ has heard many high-profile cases over the years, including the Nicaragua v. United States case, in which the court found the US guilty of violating international law by supporting Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The court has also issued advisory opinions on controversial issues, such as the legality of nuclear weapons and the construction of a wall by Israel in the West Bank. The ICJ has faced criticism over the years for its perceived lack of effectiveness and its inability to enforce its decisions. Some have also criticized the court for being biased towards powerful states and for failing to address the root causes of conflicts. Despite these criticisms, the ICJ remains an important institution in the international legal system and continues to play a vital role in resolving disputes between states and promoting the rule of law.",

Its primary objective is to promote social justice and promote decent working conditions worldwide. The ILO is the only tripartite UN agency, meaning that it brings together representatives from governments, employers, and workers to develop and promote international labor standards. The ILO has 187 member states and is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. It has a unique structure that allows for the participation of all three groups in its decision-making processes. The organization's governing body is the International Labour Conference, which meets annually and is composed of government, employer, and worker representatives. The ILO's work is guided by its Constitution, which sets out its mandate and principles. The organization's core functions include setting international labor standards, promoting social dialogue, providing technical assistance and training, and conducting research on labor issues. One of the ILO's most significant achievements is the development of international labor standards, which are conventions and recommendations that set out minimum standards for working conditions. These standards cover a wide range of issues, including child labor, forced labor, discrimination, and occupational safety and health. The ILO also promotes social dialogue, which is the process of negotiation and consultation between employers, workers, and governments. Social dialogue is essential for creating policies and programs that promote decent work and social justice. The ILO provides technical assistance and training to member states to help them implement international labor standards and improve working conditions. The organization also conducts research on labor issues and publishes reports and statistics on labor trends and conditions worldwide. In recent years, the ILO has focused on promoting decent work for all, which means ensuring that all workers have access to safe and healthy working conditions, social protection, and opportunities for personal and professional development. The organization has also been working to address the challenges posed by globalization, including the need to ensure that workers are not exploited in the global economy. Overall, the International Labour Organization plays a critical role in promoting social justice and decent working conditions worldwide. Its tripartite structure and focus on international labor standards, social dialogue, technical assistance, and research make it a unique and essential organization in the UN system.",

The movement is made up of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and 192 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The movement was founded in 1863 by Swiss businessman Henry Dunant, who was inspired by the suffering he witnessed during the Battle of Solferino in Italy. Dunant organized a group of volunteers to provide medical care to wounded soldiers, regardless of their nationality. This led to the creation of the ICRC, which is responsible for promoting and protecting the rights of victims of armed conflicts. The IFRC was established in 1919 to coordinate the activities of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world. The IFRC provides support to these societies in areas such as disaster response, health promotion, and community development. The National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies are independent organizations that operate in their respective countries. They are responsible for providing humanitarian assistance to people affected by disasters and emergencies, as well as promoting health and social welfare programs in their communities. The movement is guided by seven fundamental principles: humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality. These principles are the foundation of the movement's work and are reflected in all of its activities. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has played a significant role in responding to some of the world's most devastating disasters, including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis. The movement also provides ongoing support to communities affected by armed conflicts, such as those in Yemen, Syria, and Afghanistan. In addition to its humanitarian work, the movement also promotes international humanitarian law and advocates for the protection of civilians in armed conflicts. The movement has been awarded numerous Nobel Peace Prizes for its efforts to alleviate human suffering and promote peace and reconciliation around the world.",

Oxfam's work is focused on four main areas: humanitarian response, long-term development, campaigning and advocacy, and influencing policy and practice. The organization responds to emergencies and disasters, providing life-saving assistance to people affected by conflict, natural disasters, and other crises. Oxfam also works to address the root causes of poverty and inequality, supporting sustainable livelihoods, promoting gender equality, and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities. Oxfam's campaigning and advocacy work aims to raise awareness and mobilize public support for issues such as climate change, tax justice, and the rights of refugees and migrants. The organization also works to influence policy and practice at the national and international levels, advocating for policies that promote social justice and human rights. Oxfam is funded by a combination of individual donations, institutional grants, and partnerships with businesses and governments. The organization has faced criticism in recent years over its handling of sexual misconduct allegations involving staff members, leading to a restructuring of the organization's governance and management structures.

The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where members have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development. For travel within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999, coming into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. The EU operates through a hybrid system of supranationalism and intergovernmentalism. In certain areas, it depends upon agreement between the member states. However, it also has supranational bodies, able to make decisions without unanimity among member states. Important institutions and bodies of the EU include the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, the European Council, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank, the European Parliament, and the European Ombudsman. The European Parliament is elected every five years by EU citizens. The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by the Inner Six countries in 1951 and 1958, respectively. In the intervening years, the community and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union under its current name in 1993. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009. The EU has developed a single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where members have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development.",

The economy was heavily centralized and planned, with the state controlling all major industries and resources. The Soviet Union played a major role in World War II, emerging as one of the world's two superpowers alongside the United States. However, the country faced significant economic and political challenges in the post-war period, leading to a period of stagnation in the 1970s and 1980s.

Although the term \"continent\" implies physical geography, the land border is somewhat arbitrary and has been redefined several times since its first conception in classical antiquity.

The border does not follow political boundaries, with Turkey, Russia, and Kazakhstan being transcontinental countries.

It was first proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992 and has since been applied to a wide range of optimization problems. The algorithm works by simulating the behavior of ants as they search for food, with each ant depositing pheromone trails to mark the path it has taken. Other ants then follow these trails, with the strength of the pheromone trail increasing with the amount of food found. Over time, the pheromone trails converge on the shortest path to the food source, allowing the ants to efficiently find their way to the food. In the context of optimization, ACO works by using a similar approach to find the optimal solution to a given problem. The algorithm uses a set of artificial ants to explore the solution space, with each ant representing a potential solution. As the ants move through the solution space, they deposit pheromone trails to mark the quality of the solutions they have found. Other ants then follow these trails, with the strength of the pheromone trail increasing with the quality of the solution. Over time, the pheromone trails converge on the optimal solution, allowing the algorithm to efficiently find the best possible solution to the problem. ACO has been successfully applied to a wide range of optimization problems, including the traveling salesman problem, the vehicle routing problem, and the job shop scheduling problem.",

In 1859, he witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino, a brutal conflict between French and Austrian forces that left thousands of wounded soldiers lying on the battlefield without medical care. Horrified by the suffering he saw, Dunant organized local volunteers to provide aid to the wounded and began advocating for the creation of a neutral organization to provide medical assistance in times of war. This led to the establishment of the ICRC in 1863, which has since become one of the world's most respected humanitarian organizations. Dunant's efforts also helped to inspire the adoption of the Geneva Conventions, a series of international treaties that established rules for the treatment of wounded soldiers and prisoners of war. Despite his many achievements, Dunant struggled with financial difficulties and personal setbacks throughout his life, and he died in relative obscurity in 1910.

The Council was significant in that it marked the first time in Church history that a council was called to address internal issues rather than external threats. The Council resulted in a number of important reforms, including the establishment of a new system of papal election, the condemnation of the heresies of John Wycliffe and Jan Hus, and the reaffirmation of the doctrine of transubstantiation. The Council also paved the way for future councils, including the Council of Trent, which would play a crucial role in the Counter-Reformation.
