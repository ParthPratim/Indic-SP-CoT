Located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, it is the seat of Harris County and the principal city of the Greater Houston metropolitan area, which is the fifth-most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States and the second-most populous in Texas after the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, with a population of 7,066,141 in 2019. Comprising a total area of 637.4 square miles (1,651 km2), Houston is the eighth-most expansive city in the United States (including consolidated city-counties). It is the largest city in the United States by total area, whose government is not consolidated with that of a county, parish, or borough. Though primarily in Harris County, small portions of the city extend into Fort Bend and Montgomery counties, bordering other principal communities of Greater Houston such as Sugar Land and The Woodlands. The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30, 1836, at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou (a point now known as Allen's Landing) and incorporated as a city on June 5, 1837. The city is named after former General Sam Houston, who was president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas' independence from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles (40 km) east of Allen's Landing. After briefly serving as the capital of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s, Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century. The arrival of the 20th century saw a convergence of economic factors which fueled rapid growth in Houston, including a burgeoning port and railroad industry, the decline of Galveston as Texas' primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane, the subsequent construction of the Houston Ship Channel, and the Texas oil boom. In the mid-20th century, Houston's economy diversified as it became home to the Texas Medical Center—the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and NASA's Johnson Space Center, where the Mission Control Center is located. Houston's economy since the late 19th century has a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation.",

            "passage": "Seattle is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States. It is the largest city in the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Seattle is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canada–United States border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2015. The Seattle area was inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived from Illinois via Portland, Oregon, on the schooner Exact at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott Bay and named \"Seattle\" in 1852, after Chief Si'ahl of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes. Logging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century, the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. Growth after World War II was partially due to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed into a technology center from the 1980s onwards with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region; Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a Seattleite by birth. Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994, and major airline Alaska Airlines is based in SeaTac, Washington, serving Seattle's international airport, Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000. Seattle has a noteworthy musical history. From 1918 to 1951, nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Ernestine Anderson, and others. Seattle is also the birthplace of rock musician Jimi Hendrix, as well as the origin of the bands Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Foo Fighters and the alternative rock movement grunge.",

It is located in the South Platte River Valley on the western edge of the High Plains just east of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. With an estimated population of 727,211 in 2019, Denver is the 19th-most populous city in the United States, the fifth-most populous state capital, and the most populous city within a 500-mile (800 km) radius. The metropolitan area surrounding Denver represents a majority of the population and economic activity in the Front Range region, an area within which an estimated 85% of Colorado's population lives. Denver is named after James W. Denver, a governor of the Kansas Territory. It is nicknamed the Mile High City because its official elevation is exactly one mile (5280 feet or 1609.3 meters) above sea level, making it one of the highest major cities in the United States. The 105th meridian west of Greenwich, the longitudinal reference for the Mountain Time Zone, passes directly through Denver Union Station. Denver is home to many nationally recognized museums, including a new wing for the Denver Art Museum by world-renowned architect Daniel Libeskind, the second largest Performing Arts Center in the nation after Lincoln Center in New York City and bustling neighborhoods such as LoDo (lower downtown), filled with art galleries, restaurants, bars and clubs. That is part of the reason why Denver was, in 2006, recognized for the third year in a row as the best city for singles. Denver's neighborhoods also continue their influx of diverse people and businesses while the city's cultural institutions grow and prosper. The city acquired the estate of abstract expressionist painter Clyfford Still in 2004 and built a museum to exhibit his works near the Denver Art Museum. Denver's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection to some of the major transportation systems of the country. Because Denver is the largest city within 500 miles (800 km), it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the Mountain States, Southwest states, as well as all western states. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the Midwest, such as Chicago and St. Louis and some large cities of the West Coast, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.",

The city proper covers 48.4 square miles (125 km2) with an estimated population of 694,583 in 2018, making it the most populous city in New England. Boston is the anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area called Greater Boston, home to 4.9 million people and the tenth-largest metropolitan statistical area in the country. Greater Boston as a commuting region is home to 8.2 million people, making it the sixth-largest combined statistical area in the United States. One of the oldest cities in the United States, Boston was founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England. It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the Siege of Boston. Upon American independence from Great Britain, the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub, as well as a center for education and culture. Through land reclamation and municipal annexation, Boston has expanded beyond the original peninsula. Its rich history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year. Boston's many firsts include the United States' first public park (Boston Common, 1634), first public or state school (Boston Latin School, 1635) and first subway system (Tremont Street Subway, 1897). Today, Boston is a thriving center of scientific research as well as port of entry for commerce and international immigration. The Boston area's many colleges and universities make it a world leader in higher education, including law, medicine, engineering, and business, and the city is considered to be a global pioneer in innovation and entrepreneurship, with nearly 2,000 startups. Boston's economic base also includes finance, professional and business services, biotechnology, information technology, and government activities. Households in the city claim the highest average rate of philanthropy in the United States; businesses and institutions rank among the top in the country for environmental sustainability and investment. The city has one of the highest costs of living in the United States as it has undergone gentrification, though it remains high on world livability rankings.",

The city's population ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat; however, sections of the city are in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2020 United States census, the city had a population of 1,343,573. The city is home to many cultural institutions, including the Dallas Museum of Art, the Morton H.

The city has a rich history, having been founded in 1701 by French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, and has played a significant role in the development of the automotive industry, music, and sports. Detroit is known as the \"Motor City\" due to its association with the automobile industry, which began in the early 20th century with the founding of companies such as Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler. The city was a major center of production for automobiles and other vehicles, and was home to numerous factories and assembly plants. However, the decline of the American auto industry in the late 20th century led to a significant loss of jobs and population in Detroit, and the city has struggled with economic and social challenges in recent decades. Despite these challenges, Detroit remains a vibrant and culturally rich city, with a diverse population and a thriving arts and music scene. The city is home to numerous museums, including the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, and the Motown Museum, which celebrates the city's role in the development of Motown music.

Despite these positive developments, however, Detroit still faces significant challenges, including high levels of poverty and crime, and a struggling public school system.

It is a major port in the Willamette Valley region of the Pacific Northwest, at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers. As of 2019, Portland had an estimated population of 654,741, making it the 26th most populous city in the United States, the sixth-most populous on the West Coast, and the second-most populous in the Pacific Northwest after Seattle. Approximately 2.4 million people live in the Portland metropolitan statistical area (MSA), making it the 25th most populous in the United States. Its combined statistical area (CSA) ranks 19th-largest with a population of around 3.2 million. Approximately 60% of Oregon's population resides within the Portland metropolitan area. Named after Portland, Maine, the Oregon settlement began to be populated in the 1830s near the end of the Oregon Trail. Its water access provided convenient transportation of goods, and the timber industry was a major force in the city's early economy. At the turn of the 20th century, the city had a reputation as one of the most dangerous port cities in the world, a hub for organized crime and racketeering. After the city's economy experienced an industrial boom during World War II, its hard-edged reputation began to dissipate. Beginning in the 1960s, Portland became noted for its growing progressive political values, earning it a reputation as a bastion of counterculture. The city operates with a commission-based government guided by a mayor and four commissioners as well as Metro, the only directly elected metropolitan planning organization in the United States. The city government is notable for its land-use planning and investment in public transportation. Portland is frequently recognized as one of the world's most environmentally conscious cities because of its high walkability, large community of bicyclists, farm-to-table dining, expansive network of public transportation options, and over 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of public parks. Its climate is marked by warm, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. This climate is ideal for growing roses, and Portland has been called the \"City of Roses\" for over a century. The city is home to numerous museums, parks, and gardens, including the Portland Art Museum, Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, Portland Japanese Garden, Lan Su Chinese Garden, and the International Rose Test Garden.",

It is also the fastest growing large city in the United States and the southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States. As of the U.S. Census Bureau's July 1, 2019, estimate, Austin had a population of 978,908, up from 790,491 at the 2010 census. The city is the cultural and economic center of the Austin–Round Rock metropolitan statistical area, which had an estimated population of 2,227,083 as of July 1, 2019, nearly an 80% increase from the year 2000. Located in Central Texas within the greater Texas Hill Country, it is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways, including Lady Bird Lake and Lake Travis on the Colorado River, Barton Springs, McKinney Falls, and Lake Walter E. Long. In the 1830s, pioneers began to settle the area in central Austin along the Colorado River. In 1839, the site was chosen to replace Houston as the capital of the Republic of Texas and was incorporated under the name \"Waterloo\". Shortly thereafter, the name was changed to Austin in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the \"Father of Texas\" and the republic's first secretary of state. The city grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the Texas State Capitol and the University of Texas at Austin. After a lull in growth from the Great Depression, Austin resumed its development into a major city and, by the 1980s, it emerged as a center for technology and business. A number of Fortune 500 companies have headquarters or regional offices in Austin, including Amazon, Apple, Dell, IBM, and Whole Foods Market.

The city is situated along the western bank of the Mississippi River, which forms the border between Missouri and Illinois. St. Louis has a rich history, having been founded by French fur traders in 1764 and named after King Louis IX of France. St. Louis is known for its iconic Gateway Arch, which stands at 630 feet tall and is the tallest man-made monument in the United States. The arch was built in the 1960s as a symbol of the city's role as the \"Gateway to the West,\" commemorating the westward expansion of the United States in the 19th century. The arch is part of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, which also includes the Old Courthouse and the Museum of Westward Expansion.

On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the Kansas Territory.

Sitting on Missouri's western border, with downtown near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the modern city encompasses some 319.03 square miles (826.3 km2), making it the 23rd largest city by total area in the United States. Most of the city lies within Jackson County, but portions spill into Clay, Cass, and Platte counties. Along with Independence, one of its major suburbs, it serves as one of the two county seats of Jackson County. Other major suburbs include the Missouri cities of Blue Springs and Lee's Summit and the Kansas cities of Overland Park, Olathe, and Kansas City. The city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the River Market District in the north, the 18th and Vine District in the east, and the Country Club Plaza in the south. Kansas City is known for its barbecue, jazz heritage, fountains, and craft breweries.

With an estimated population of 651,073 in 2019, it is the second-largest city in Tennessee, after Nashville, and the 26th largest in the United States. Memphis is the seat of Shelby County, the most populous county in Tennessee. As one of the most historic and culturally significant cities in the southern United States, Memphis has a rich and diverse history that has shaped its identity and culture. Founded in 1819, Memphis grew rapidly as a transportation hub for the Mississippi River and the surrounding agricultural region. By the mid-19th century, it had become one of the largest and wealthiest cities in the southern United States, with a thriving economy based on cotton and other agricultural products. However, the city's prosperity was interrupted by the American Civil War, during which it was occupied by Union forces and suffered significant damage. In the decades following the war, Memphis experienced a period of rapid growth and development, fueled by the expansion of the railroad and the emergence of the city as a major center of commerce and industry. The city became a hub for the blues and other forms of African American music, and was home to a vibrant cultural scene that included the famous Beale Street entertainment district. Memphis played a key role in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, and was the site of several important events, including the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. In the years following King's death, Memphis struggled with economic decline and social unrest, but has since rebounded and become a thriving center of business, culture, and tourism. Today, Memphis is known for its rich musical heritage, including the blues, rock and roll, and soul music, as well as its world-famous barbecue and other culinary traditions. The city is home to several major attractions, including the National Civil Rights Museum, Graceland (the former home of Elvis Presley), and the Memphis Zoo. With its vibrant culture, rich history, and diverse population, Memphis remains one of the most important and influential cities in the southern United States.",

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the consolidated population of Indianapolis and Marion County was 886,220. The \"balance\" population, which excludes semi-autonomous municipalities in Marion County, was 876,384. It is the 17th most populous city in the U.S., the third-most populous city in the Midwest, after Chicago, Illinois and Columbus, Ohio, and the fourth-most populous state capital after Phoenix, Arizona; Austin, Texas; and Columbus, Ohio. The Indianapolis metropolitan area is the 33rd most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U.S., with 2,048,703 residents. Its combined statistical area ranks 28th, with a population of 2,431,361. Indianapolis covers 368 square miles (950 km2), making it the 16th largest city by land area in the U.S.\n\nIndigenous peoples inhabited the area dating to approximately 2000 BC. In 1818, the Delaware relinquished their tribal lands in the Treaty of St. Mary's. In 1821, Indianapolis was founded as a planned city for the new seat of Indiana's state government. The city was platted by Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham on a 1 square mile (2.6 km2) grid next to the White River. Completion of the National and Michigan roads and arrival of rail later solidified the city's position as a manufacturing and transportation hub. Two of the city's nicknames reflect its historical ties to transportation—the \"Crossroads of America\" and \"Railroad City\". Since the 1970 city-county consolidation, known as Unigov, local government administration operates under the direction of an elected 25-member city-county council headed by the mayor. Indianapolis anchors the 27th largest economic region in the U.S., based primarily on the sectors of finance and insurance, manufacturing, professional and business services, education and health care, government, and wholesale trade. The city has notable niche markets in amateur sports and auto racing. The Fortune 500 companies of Anthem, Eli Lilly and Company, and Simon Property Group are headquartered in Indianapolis. The city has hosted many international multi-sport events, such as the 1987 Pan American Games and 2001 World Police and Fire Games, but is perhaps best known for annually hosting the world's largest single-day sporting event, the Indianapolis 500.",

Tidal waters influence the Hudson's flow from as far north as the city of Troy. The river is named after Henry Hudson, an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company, who explored it in 1609, and after whom Canada's Hudson Bay is also named. It had previously been observed by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailing for King Francis I of France in 1524, as he became the first European known to have entered the Upper New York Bay, but he considered the river to be an estuary. The Dutch called the river the North River – with the Delaware River called the South River – and it formed the spine of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. Settlements of the colony clustered around the Hudson, and its strategic importance as the gateway to the American interior led to years of competition between the English and the Dutch over control of the river and colony.",

These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's founding principle, a popular 1868 Ezra Cornell quotation: \"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.\" The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and one in Education City, Qatar. Cornell is one of three private land grant universities in the nation and the only one in New York. Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York (SUNY) system, including its agricultural and veterinary colleges. As a land grant college, it operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions. The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 745 acres, but is much larger when the Cornell Botanic Gardens (more than 4,300 acres) and the numerous university-owned lands in New York City are considered.

The student body consists of more than 14,000 undergraduate and 8,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and 119 countries. Cornell University was founded on April 27, 1865; the New York State (NYS) Senate authorized the university as the state's land grant institution. Senator Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York, as a site and $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial endowment.

After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan's retirement, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season.

The company was founded in 1995 and has since grown to become one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in the United States. ETP operates a network of pipelines, terminals, and storage facilities that span across the country, connecting major production areas with key markets and refineries. One of ETP's most notable projects is the Dakota Access Pipeline, a controversial 1,172-mile pipeline that transports crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The pipeline has faced opposition from environmental groups and Native American tribes, who argue that it poses a threat to water sources and sacred sites. Despite these concerns, the pipeline was completed in 2017 and has since been in operation. In addition to its pipeline operations, ETP also owns and operates several natural gas processing plants and fractionation facilities. These facilities extract valuable natural gas liquids (NGLs) from raw natural gas and separate them into individual components, such as propane, butane, and ethane. These NGLs are then transported to market via pipeline or rail. ETP has faced criticism for its environmental record, particularly in relation to its pipeline operations. The company has been cited for numerous spills and leaks, including a major incident in 2010 when one of its pipelines ruptured in Michigan, spilling over 800,000 gallons of crude oil into the Kalamazoo River. ETP has since implemented measures to improve safety and prevent future incidents, but its operations continue to be closely scrutinized by regulators and environmental groups.",

He founded the men's Order of Friars Minor, the women's Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis for men and women not able to live the lives of itinerant preachers, followed by the early members of the Order of Friars Minor, or the monastic lives of the Poor Clares. Francis is one of the most venerated religious figures in Christianity. Pope Gregory IX canonized Francis on July 16, 1228. Along with Saint Catherine of Siena, he was designated patron saint of Italy. He later became associated with patronage of animals and the natural environment, and it became customary for Catholic and Anglican churches to hold ceremonies blessing animals on his feast day of October 4. He is often remembered as the patron saint of animals. In 1219, he went to Egypt in an attempt to convert the Sultan to put an end to the conflict of the Crusades. By this point, the Franciscan Order had grown to such an extent that its primitive organizational structure was no longer sufficient. He returned to Italy to organize the Order. Once his community was authorized by the Pope, he withdrew increasingly from external affairs. In 1223, Francis arranged for the first Christmas manger scene. In 1224, he received the stigmata, making him the first recorded person to bear the wounds of Christ's Passion. He died during the evening hours of October 3, 1226, while listening to a reading he had requested of Psalm 142 (141). On July 16, 1228, he was pronounced a saint by Pope Gregory IX (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, friend of Saint Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the Pope laid the foundation stone for the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi.",

He came to the United States in 1777 to fight in the American Revolutionary War and later settled in New York City, where he worked as an architect and engineer. In 1789, he was appointed by President George Washington to design the new federal capital city, which was to be located on the Potomac River. L'Enfant's plan for the city featured a grand central avenue, which he called the \"Grand Avenue,\" that would run from the Capitol building to the Potomac River. He also designed a system of diagonal streets that intersected with the grid of streets, creating open spaces and vistas throughout the city. Despite his vision for the city, L'Enfant was dismissed from the project in 1792 due to conflicts with local landowners and government officials. However, his plan for the city was largely followed and remains a defining feature of Washington, D.C. today.

He joined the French army at a young age and served in various campaigns in Europe before being sent to Canada in 1683. In Canada, Cadillac quickly established himself as a skilled trader and entrepreneur. He became involved in the fur trade and established a trading post on the Detroit River in 1701, which he named Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit.

During his time as governor, he worked to improve the economy and infrastructure of the colony, and he also established the city of Mobile, Alabama. Despite his many accomplishments, Cadillac was not without controversy. He was accused of corruption and mismanagement during his time as governor, and he was eventually recalled to France in 1717.

Arizona shares the Four Corners region with Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico; its other neighboring states are Nevada and California to the west and the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California to the south and southwest. Arizona is known for its desert climate, exceptionally hot summers, and mild winters, but it also features pine forests and mountain ranges in the northern high country, with much cooler weather than the lower deserts. The state's name appears to originate from an earlier Spanish name, Arizonac, derived from the O'odham name alĭ ṣonak, meaning \"small spring\", which initially applied only to an area near the silver mining camp of Planchas de Plata, Sonora. To the European settlers, their pronunciation sounded like \"Arissona\". The area is still known as alĭ ṣonak in the O'odham language. Another possible origin is the Basque phrase haritz ona (\"the good oak\"), as there were numerous Basque sheepherders in the area.",

He was born in Portugal in 1499 and later became a naturalized Spanish citizen. In 1542, he was commissioned by the Spanish government to explore the coast of California and search for a possible route to Asia. Cabrillo set sail from Navidad, Mexico, with a fleet of two ships and a crew of about 200 men. After sailing up the coast of Baja California, Cabrillo and his crew reached San Diego Bay in September 1542. They continued northward, exploring the coast and making contact with the native Chumash people. In November, they reached what is now known as the Santa Barbara Channel and anchored near the present-day city of Santa Barbara. Cabrillo's expedition continued up the coast, but in December, he suffered a serious injury while trying to land on the shore of San Miguel Island. He died a few days later from complications of the injury. Despite his untimely death, Cabrillo's expedition was considered a success, as it was the first European exploration of the California coast. Today, Cabrillo is remembered as a significant figure in the history of California and the exploration of the Americas. His name is commemorated in many places, including the Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego and the Cabrillo Beach Coastal Park in Los Angeles.",

The church is named after Saint Didacus of Alcala, a Spanish Franciscan lay brother who lived in the 15th century. The original church was built of adobe and was destroyed by fire in 1775. It was rebuilt in 1780 and again in 1813. The current church was built in 1931 and is a replica of the 1813 church. It is a simple, white-washed building with a bell tower and a red-tiled roof. San Diego de Alcala was the first of 21 missions established by Father Serra along the California coast. The mission system was designed to convert the native people to Christianity and to establish Spanish control over the region. The missions were self-sufficient communities that included a church, living quarters for the friars, workshops, and gardens. Today, San Diego de Alcala is a popular tourist attraction and a functioning Catholic church. It is also a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The church is open to visitors and offers guided tours of the mission grounds and museum.

            "passage": "Ernest Hemingway was an American novelist, short story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Three of his novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature. Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school, he became a journalist for a few months before enlisting in the United States Army during World War I. He was injured in Italy and hospitalized in Milan, where he met American nurse Agnes von Kurowsky, who gave him a copy of Dante's Inferno, which inspired him to write. After the war, he returned to the United States and worked for newspapers in Kansas City and Toronto. He moved to Paris in 1921, where he became part of the expatriate community of writers and artists known as the \"Lost Generation\". His first novel, The Sun Also Rises, was published in 1926. Hemingway's distinctive writing style is characterized by economy and understatement, and he often wrote in short, declarative sentences. His protagonists are typically stoic and masculine, and his stories often deal with themes of war, love, loss, and death. Hemingway was also known for his adventurous lifestyle, which included big-game hunting, deep-sea fishing, and bullfighting. He was married four times and had three sons. Hemingway suffered from depression and alcoholism throughout his life, and he committed suicide in 1961.",

King advanced civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi. He was the son of early civil rights activist Martin Luther King Sr.\n\nKing led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957, serving as its first president. With the SCLC, King led an unsuccessful 1962 struggle against segregation in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize the 1963 nonviolent protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King also helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech. On October 14, 1964, King received the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches, and the following year he and the SCLC took the movement north to Chicago to work on segregated housing. In the final years of his life, King expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War, alienating many of his liberal allies with a 1967 speech titled \"Beyond Vietnam\". In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities. King's legacy influenced the Black Consciousness Movement and the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the consolidated population of Indianapolis and Marion County was 886,220. The \"balance\" population, which excludes semi-autonomous municipalities in Marion County, was 876,384. It is the 17th most populous city in the U.S., the third-most populous city in the Midwest, after Chicago, Illinois and Columbus, Ohio, and the fourth-most populous state capital after Phoenix, Arizona; Austin, Texas; and Columbus, Ohio. The Indianapolis metropolitan area is the 33rd most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U.S., with 2,048,703 residents. Its combined statistical area ranks 28th, with a population of 2,431,361. Indianapolis covers 368 square miles (950 km2), making it the 16th largest city by land area in the U.S.\n\nIndigenous peoples inhabited the area dating to approximately 2000 BC. In 1818, the Delaware relinquished their tribal lands in the Treaty of St. Mary's. In 1821, Indianapolis was founded as a planned city for the new seat of Indiana's state government. The city was platted by Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham on a 1 square mile (2.6 km2) grid next to the White River. Completion of the National and Michigan roads and arrival of rail later solidified the city's position as a manufacturing and transportation hub. Two of the city's nicknames reflect its historical ties to transportation—the \"Crossroads of America\" and \"Railroad City\". Since the 1970 city-county consolidation, known as Unigov, local government administration operates under the direction of an elected 25-member city-county council headed by the mayor. Indianapolis anchors the 27th largest economic region in the U.S., based primarily on the sectors of finance and insurance, manufacturing, professional and business services, education and health care, government, and wholesale trade. The city has notable niche markets in amateur sports and auto racing. The Fortune 500 companies of Anthem, Eli Lilly and Company, and Simon Property Group are headquartered in Indianapolis. The city has hosted many international multi-sport events, such as the 1987 Pan American Games and 2001 World Police and Fire Games, but is perhaps best known for annually hosting the world's largest single-day sporting event, the Indianapolis 500.",

Ralston was born in Scotland and trained as a surveyor before immigrating to the United States in 1795. He settled in Philadelphia, where he worked as a surveyor and became involved in the city's architectural community. In 1802, Ralston was hired by the Indiana Territory to survey and plan the new capital city of Indianapolis. He worked closely with Indiana Governor William Henry Harrison to design a city that would be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Ralston's plan for Indianapolis was based on a grid system, with wide streets and public squares. He also included a large central circle, which would become the heart of the city's downtown area. Ralston's plan for Indianapolis was widely praised for its beauty and efficiency. However, it was not without controversy. Some residents of the city objected to the wide streets and large public spaces, arguing that they were a waste of valuable land. Others criticized Ralston's decision to include a large central circle, which they felt was unnecessary. Despite these criticisms, Ralston's plan for Indianapolis was ultimately adopted and remains largely intact to this day. The city's downtown area is still centered around the large central circle, and the grid system that Ralston designed continues to be a defining feature of the city's layout. Today, Alexander Ralston is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of Indianapolis and a pioneer in the field of urban planning.",
