            "passage": "George Washington was an American political leader, military general, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. He played a key role in the American Revolution, leading the Continental Army to victory over the British in 1783. Washington was born on February 22, 1732, in Westmoreland County, Virginia, to a wealthy planter family. He was educated at home and later became a surveyor, which led him to explore the western frontier of Virginia. In 1754, Washington began his military career as a colonel in the Virginia militia during the French and Indian War. He gained valuable experience in military strategy and leadership, which would serve him well in the American Revolution. After the war, he returned to his plantation, Mount Vernon, where he became involved in politics and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses. In 1775, Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army by the Second Continental Congress. He faced many challenges during the war, including a lack of resources and support from Congress, but he persevered and eventually led the army to victory at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. After the war, he retired to Mount Vernon, but was called back into public service to preside over the Constitutional Convention in 1787. Washington was unanimously elected as the first president of the United States in 1789. During his presidency, he established many of the traditions and precedents that are still followed today, including the two-term limit for presidents. He also oversaw the creation of the federal government and the adoption of the Bill of Rights. Washington's legacy as a leader and statesman is widely recognized. He is often referred to as the \"Father of His Country\" and is considered one of the most important figures in American history. His image appears on the one-dollar bill and the quarter, and many cities and towns across the United States are named after him.",

As a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great. After the death of Cleopatra's father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, she and her younger brother Ptolemy XIII became joint rulers of Egypt. However, a dispute between the siblings eventually led to a civil war, and Cleopatra was forced to flee Egypt for Syria. There, she raised an army and returned to Egypt, where she defeated her brother's forces and became sole ruler. Cleopatra's reign was marked by political intrigue and alliances with powerful Roman leaders, including Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. She became Caesar's lover and bore him a son, Caesarion. After Caesar's assassination, Cleopatra aligned herself with Mark Antony and became his lover as well. Together, they had three children. However, their relationship was threatened by Antony's marriage to Octavian's sister, Octavia, and the two eventually went to war against Octavian. In 31 BC, Cleopatra and Antony were defeated at the Battle of Actium, and they both committed suicide the following year. Cleopatra's death marked the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty and the beginning of Roman Egypt. She is remembered for her beauty, intelligence, and political savvy, as well as her tragic end. Her story has been retold in countless works of literature, art, and film, cementing her place as one of history's most iconic figures.",

            "passage": "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist, who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule, and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: \"great-souled\", \"venerable\"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world. Born and raised in a Hindu merchant caste family in coastal Gujarat, western India, Gandhi was trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, and called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics. He was imprisoned many times for his activism, including for his opposition to the British Raj, and spent long periods in jail on numerous occasions. In 1915, Gandhi returned to India permanently. He set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for various social causes and for achieving Swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South Africa and India. Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence.",

He was born into a patrician family, the gens Julia, which claimed descent from the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas and the goddess Venus. Caesar's political career began in 69 BC when he was elected quaestor, a position that gave him responsibility for financial administration in Rome. He later served as aedile and praetor before being appointed governor of the province of Further Spain in 61 BC. Caesar's military campaigns in Gaul (modern-day France) from 58 to 50 BC were among his most significant achievements. He conquered the region and expanded the Roman Empire's territory, earning him immense popularity and wealth. However, his success also made him a threat to the Roman Senate, which feared his growing power and influence. In 49 BC, Caesar defied the Senate's orders to disband his army and return to Rome, instead crossing the Rubicon River with his troops and igniting a civil war. Caesar emerged victorious from the ensuing conflict, defeating his rival Pompey and becoming the sole ruler of Rome. He implemented a series of reforms aimed at strengthening the central government and improving the lives of ordinary citizens, including the establishment of a new calendar and the construction of public works. However, his autocratic rule and perceived arrogance alienated many of his former allies, and he was assassinated by a group of senators on the Ides of March in 44 BC. Despite his controversial legacy, Caesar remains one of the most influential figures in Western history. His military conquests and political reforms laid the foundation for the Roman Empire, and his writings on military strategy and political philosophy continue to be studied and admired today.

            "passage": "Napoleon Bonaparte was a French statesman and military leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and its associated wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his campaigns are studied at military academies worldwide. Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica in 1769, and he received a military education at the École Militaire in Paris. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military during the French Revolution, becoming a general at the age of 24. In 1799, he staged a coup d'état and became First Consul of the Republic. In 1804, he crowned himself Emperor of the French, and his reign saw the implementation of a series of reforms that modernized French society and made it a model for the rest of Europe. Napoleon's military campaigns were marked by a series of stunning victories, including the Battle of Austerlitz, the Battle of Borodino, and the Battle of Waterloo. He also implemented a series of administrative and legal reforms that transformed France into a modern state. These included the Napoleonic Code, which established a uniform legal system throughout France, and the creation of a centralized bureaucracy that replaced the feudal system of government that had existed before the Revolution. Despite his many successes, Napoleon's empire was ultimately undone by a combination of factors, including the rise of nationalism in conquered territories, the failure of his economic policies, and the military might of his enemies. He was exiled to the island of Elba in 1814, but he escaped and returned to France the following year. He was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled again, this time to the remote island of Saint Helena, where he died in 1821. Napoleon's legacy is complex and controversial. He is remembered as a brilliant military strategist and a visionary leader who transformed France and Europe, but he is also criticized for his authoritarian tendencies and his role in the deaths of millions of people during his wars of conquest.",

His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc^2, which has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909). However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 introducing his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole. He was visiting the United States when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 and, being Jewish, did not go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He settled in the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\" and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. This eventually led to the Manhattan Project. Einstein supported the Allies, but he generally denounced the idea of using nuclear fission as a weapon. He signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto with British philosopher Bertrand Russell, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works.",

She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the first person to win two Nobel Prizes in different fields. Born Maria Skłodowska in Warsaw, Poland, Curie was the youngest of five children. Her parents were both teachers, and they instilled in her a love of learning from a young age. Despite facing discrimination as a woman and a foreigner, Curie excelled in her studies and eventually earned a degree in physics from the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1895, Curie married Pierre Curie, a fellow physicist, and the two began working together on the study of radioactivity. They discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, and developed techniques for isolating and measuring radioactivity. Their work revolutionized the field of physics and chemistry, and earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. After Pierre's death in 1906, Curie continued her research and teaching, becoming the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne. She also founded the Radium Institute in Paris, which became a center for research on radioactivity. In 1911, Curie won her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her discovery of radium and polonium. She was the first person to win two Nobel Prizes in different fields, and remains one of only four people to have achieved this feat. Throughout her career, Curie faced discrimination and sexism, but she remained dedicated to her work and her passion for science.

Elizabeth was born on September 7, 1533, at Greenwich Palace in London. She was declared illegitimate after her mother was executed for treason when Elizabeth was just two years old. Elizabeth was educated at home and was fluent in several languages, including Latin, Greek, French, and Italian. She was a skilled musician and dancer and was known for her intelligence and wit. Elizabeth's half-sister, Queen Mary I, succeeded their father as queen in 1553. Mary was a devout Catholic and persecuted Protestants during her reign. Elizabeth was also a Protestant, and she was imprisoned in the Tower of London for a time during Mary's reign. After Mary's death in 1558, Elizabeth became queen. She was just 25 years old at the time. Elizabeth's reign was marked by stability and prosperity. She was a strong and effective leader who was able to navigate the complex political and religious issues of the time. Elizabeth was known for her moderation and tolerance, and she was able to maintain a delicate balance between Catholics and Protestants in England. Elizabeth's reign was also marked by a flourishing of the arts and literature. She was a patron of the arts and supported many famous writers and playwrights, including William Shakespeare. Elizabeth was also a skilled politician and diplomat. She was able to negotiate treaties with other European powers and was able to maintain England's position as a major power in Europe. Elizabeth never married and was known as the \"Virgin Queen.\" She was courted by many suitors, including several European princes, but she never married. Elizabeth's refusal to marry was a source of controversy and speculation during her reign. Some believed that she was secretly married, while others believed that she was asexual or had a romantic relationship with one of her female courtiers. Elizabeth died on March 24, 1603, at the age of 69. She was succeeded by James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England. Elizabeth's reign is remembered as a golden age in English history. She was a strong and effective leader who was able to maintain stability and prosperity during a time of great political and religious turmoil.

            "passage": "Martin Luther King Jr. (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the civil rights movement from 1954 until his assassination in 1968. King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi. King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957, serving as its first president. With the SCLC, King led an unsuccessful 1962 struggle against segregation in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize the 1963 nonviolent protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King also helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech. On October 14, 1964, King received the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches, and the following year he and the SCLC took the movement north to Chicago to work on segregated housing. In the final years of his life, King expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War, alienating many of his liberal allies with a 1967 speech titled \"Beyond Vietnam\". In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee.

As Prime Minister, Churchill led Britain to victory in the Second World War. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century. Churchill was born into an aristocratic family and was educated at Harrow School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He served in the British Army during the Second Boer War and later became a war correspondent. Churchill entered politics in 1900 and was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in 1908. He switched to the Liberal Party in 1904 and served as President of the Board of Trade, Home Secretary, and First Lord of the Admiralty before the outbreak of the First World War. During the war, Churchill played a key role in the Gallipoli Campaign and later served as Minister of Munitions and Secretary of State for War and Air. He was instrumental in the formation of the Royal Air Force and was a strong advocate for the use of air power in warfare. After the war, Churchill returned to the Conservative Party and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1924 to 1929. He was a vocal opponent of Indian independence and supported the policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany in the 1930s. However, he became a fierce critic of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement and called for a more aggressive stance towards Germany. In 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister and led Britain through the darkest days of the Second World War. He rallied the British people with his stirring speeches and refused to negotiate with Hitler, even when Britain stood alone against Nazi Germany. Churchill formed a close alliance with the United States and the Soviet Union and played a key role in the defeat of Germany. After the war, Churchill was re-elected as Prime Minister in 1951 and served until 1955. He was a strong advocate for European unity and played a key role in the formation of the Council of Europe and the European Union. Churchill was also a prolific writer and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 for his historical and biographical works. Churchill suffered a stroke in 1953 and retired from politics in 1955. He remained a popular figure and was widely regarded as a national hero.",

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American presidents, and his leadership during the Civil War is considered to be one of the most important moments in American history. Born in a log cabin in Kentucky in 1809, Lincoln grew up in poverty and received only a limited education. He worked as a store clerk, a surveyor, and a postmaster before studying law and becoming a successful lawyer in Illinois. He was elected to the Illinois state legislature in 1834 and served four terms before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846. Lincoln's political career was marked by his opposition to the expansion of slavery into new territories. He was a member of the newly formed Republican Party, which was dedicated to stopping the spread of slavery. In 1860, he was elected president, defeating three other candidates, including the incumbent, James Buchanan. Lincoln's presidency was dominated by the Civil War, which began just weeks after he took office. He was determined to preserve the Union, even if it meant fighting a bloody war. He issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which declared that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were to be set free. This was a major turning point in the war and helped to shift public opinion in favor of the Union. Lincoln's leadership during the war was marked by his ability to inspire and motivate his troops. He visited the front lines frequently and was known for his speeches, including the famous Gettysburg Address. He also worked tirelessly to build support for the war effort, both at home and abroad. Despite his success as a wartime leader, Lincoln faced significant opposition from within his own party. Many Republicans were unhappy with his moderate stance on issues such as slavery and civil rights. He also faced criticism from Democrats, who accused him of being a tyrant and violating the Constitution. Lincoln was re-elected in 1864, but his second term was cut short by his assassination in April 1865. He was shot by John Wilkes Booth while attending a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. His death was a shock to the nation, and he is still remembered as one of the greatest presidents in American history. In addition to his leadership during the Civil War, Lincoln is also known for his eloquent speeches and his commitment to civil rights.",

            "term": "William Shakespeare",
            "passage": "William Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and one of the world's greatest dramatists. He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as \"not of an age, but for all time\". Shakespeare's plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.",

            "passage": "Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was an Italian polymath who is widely considered one of the greatest artists of all time. He was also a scientist, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. Born out of wedlock to a notary and a peasant woman, Leonardo grew up in the Tuscan countryside and received only a basic education in reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, he showed an early talent for drawing and painting, and at the age of 14, he was apprenticed to the artist Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence. During his apprenticeship, Leonardo learned the techniques of painting, sculpture, metalworking, and drafting, as well as the principles of perspective, anatomy, and light and shadow. He also developed his own style, characterized by a subtle use of color, a mastery of chiaroscuro, and a keen observation of nature. Some of his early works, such as the Annunciation and the Baptism of Christ, show a remarkable skill in depicting human emotions and gestures. After completing his apprenticeship, Leonardo worked as an independent artist and received commissions from various patrons, including the Medici family and the Duke of Milan. In Milan, he created some of his most famous works, such as The Last Supper, a mural painting in the refectory of the Santa Maria delle Grazie monastery, and the Vitruvian Man, a drawing that illustrates the proportions of the human body according to the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius. In addition to his artistic achievements, Leonardo was also a prolific inventor and scientist. He designed flying machines, war machines, hydraulic pumps, and other devices that anticipated modern technology. He also conducted experiments in optics, acoustics, and mechanics, and made important discoveries in the fields of anatomy, geology, and botany. His notebooks, which contain thousands of pages of drawings, sketches, and notes, are a testament to his curiosity and creativity. Despite his many talents, Leonardo was often plagued by self-doubt and procrastination, and many of his projects remained unfinished. He also had a reputation for being eccentric and unpredictable, and his personal life was marked by a series of romantic relationships with both men and women. Nevertheless, his legacy as a Renaissance genius has endured to this day, and his influence can be seen in the works of countless artists, scientists, and inventors who have followed in his footsteps.",

He was tutored by the philosopher Aristotle until the age of 16 and succeeded his father as king at the age of 20. Alexander's military campaigns began in 334 BC when he invaded the Persian Empire, which was then the largest empire in the world. He defeated the Persian king Darius III at the Battle of Issus in 333 BC and went on to conquer Egypt, where he founded the city of Alexandria. He then marched eastward into Asia, defeating the Persian army again at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC. Alexander continued his conquests, reaching as far east as India before turning back towards Greece. He died in Babylon in 323 BC at the age of 32, possibly from malaria or poisoning. Alexander's legacy is significant. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history, and his conquests spread Greek culture and ideas throughout the ancient world. He founded numerous cities, many of which were named after him, and his empire became a model for later conquerors such as Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte. Despite his military successes, Alexander was also known for his personal qualities. He was a skilled diplomat and was able to win the loyalty of his soldiers through his charisma and leadership. He was also known for his generosity towards his friends and allies, and his respect for the cultures and traditions of the peoples he conquered. Alexander's life and achievements have been the subject of numerous books, films, and other works of art.

He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalized racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the village of Mvezo in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. He was the son of a local chief and was educated at a Methodist mission school. He later attended the University of Fort Hare, where he became involved in student politics and was expelled for participating in a protest. In 1944, Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC), a political party that fought against apartheid, a system of racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced by the white minority government of South Africa. He became a leader of the ANC's Youth League and was instrumental in the organization's adoption of nonviolent resistance as a tactic. In 1962, Mandela was arrested and charged with sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and spent 27 years in prison, most of it on Robben Island, a notorious prison off the coast of Cape Town. During his imprisonment, Mandela became a symbol of the anti-apartheid movement and gained international recognition for his struggle against racial oppression. Mandela was released from prison in 1990, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end apartheid and promote racial reconciliation. The following year, he was elected President of South Africa in the country's first democratic election. Mandela's presidency was marked by his commitment to reconciliation and his efforts to build a new, non-racial South Africa. After leaving office, Mandela continued to work for social justice and human rights through the Nelson Mandela Foundation, which he established in 1999. He also founded the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which provides support to children affected by HIV/AIDS and poverty. Mandela died on December 5, 2013, at the age of 95.

Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, Freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. As an inventor, he is known for the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove, among other inventions. He founded many civic organizations, including the Library Company, Philadelphia's first fire department, and the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin earned the title of \"The First Citizen of the 18th Century\" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity, initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies. As the first United States Ambassador to France, he exemplified the emerging American nation. Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager, \"In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat.\" To Walter Isaacson, this makes Franklin \"the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become.\" Franklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies, publishing the Pennsylvania Gazette at the age of 23. He became wealthy publishing this and Poor Richard's Almanack, which he authored under the pseudonym \"Richard Saunders\". After 1767, he was associated with the Pennsylvania Chronicle, a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the British policies. He pioneered and was the first president of Academy and College of Philadelphia which opened in 1751 and later became the University of Pennsylvania. He organized and was the first secretary of the American Philosophical Society and was elected president in 1769. Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the Parliament of Great Britain repeal the unpopular Stamp Act.",

Born in Domrémy, a village in northeastern France, she was the daughter of Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle Romée. Joan said she received visions of the Archangel Michael, Saint Margaret, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to support Charles VII and recover France from English domination late in the Hundred Years' War. The uncrowned King Charles VII sent Joan to the siege of Orléans as part of a relief mission. She gained prominence after the siege was lifted only nine days later. Several additional swift victories led to Charles VII's coronation at Reims. This long-awaited event boosted French morale and paved the way for the final French victory. On 23 May 1430, she was captured at Compiègne by the Burgundian faction, a group of French nobles allied with the English. She was later handed over to the English and put on trial by the pro-English Bishop of Beauvais Pierre Cauchon on a variety of charges. After Cauchon declared her guilty, she was burned at the stake on 30 May 1431, dying at about nineteen years of age. Joan of Arc has remained a popular figure in literature, painting, sculpture, and other cultural works since the time of her death, and many famous writers, playwrights, filmmakers, artists, and composers have created works about her. Cultural depictions of her have continued in films, television, and music. The Hundred Years' War had begun in 1337 as an inheritance dispute over the French throne, interspersed with occasional periods of relative peace. Nearly all the fighting had taken place in France, and the English army's use of chevauchée tactics (destructive \"scorched earth\" raids) had devastated the economy. The French population had not recovered from the Black Death of the 14th century and its economy was in shambles. At the time of Joan's birth, the English had conquered much of northern France and were continuing to expand into the south. The English invasion and occupation was not without controversy among the English, with some arguing that the English claim to the French throne was not valid. Nonetheless, the English continued to advance.",

            "passage": "Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was a German composer and pianist who is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western classical music. He was born in Bonn, Germany, and showed an early talent for music, studying with his father and other local musicians. In 1787, he moved to Vienna, where he studied with Joseph Haydn and other prominent musicians. Beethoven's early works were influenced by the classical style of Haydn and Mozart, but he soon began to develop his own unique style, characterized by dramatic contrasts, complex harmonies, and a powerful emotional intensity. He wrote in a wide range of genres, including symphonies, concertos, chamber music, piano sonatas, and opera. Beethoven's career was marked by a series of personal and professional challenges. He began to lose his hearing in his late twenties, and by the time he was in his forties, he was almost completely deaf. Despite this, he continued to compose, using a special hearing aid and relying on his memory and imagination to create some of his most famous works. Beethoven's music was often political and social in nature, reflecting his own struggles and the turbulent times in which he lived. His Ninth Symphony, with its famous \"Ode to Joy\" chorus, is a celebration of human brotherhood and unity, while his opera Fidelio is a powerful statement of the need for freedom and justice. Beethoven's legacy has had a profound impact on the development of Western classical music. His innovations in form, harmony, and expression paved the way for the Romantic era of music that followed, and his influence can be heard in the works of countless composers who came after him. Today, Beethoven's music remains a beloved and essential part of the classical repertoire, and his name is synonymous with artistic genius and creative inspiration.",

It was ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty, which was founded by Ptolemy I Soter, one of the generals of Alexander the Great. The kingdom was established in 305 BC after the death of Alexander and lasted until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. Under the Ptolemies, Egypt became a major center of Hellenistic culture and commerce. The capital city of Alexandria was one of the most important cities in the ancient world, known for its great library and its famous lighthouse, the Pharos. The Ptolemies also built many other cities and monuments throughout Egypt, including the temple of Edfu and the temple of Philae. The Ptolemaic dynasty was known for its patronage of the arts and sciences. The mathematician Euclid, the astronomer Hipparchus, and the philosopher and scientist Eratosthenes were all active during this period. The Ptolemies also supported the development of the Greek language and literature in Egypt, and many important works of Greek literature were written during this time. Despite its cultural achievements, the Ptolemaic Kingdom was also marked by political instability and conflict. The Ptolemies frequently engaged in wars with neighboring kingdoms, including the Seleucid Empire and the Kingdom of Pontus. The kingdom also faced internal challenges, including revolts by the native Egyptian population and struggles for power within the ruling dynasty. In the end, the Ptolemaic Kingdom was unable to resist the growing power of Rome. In 30 BC, the Roman general Octavian (later known as Augustus) defeated the last Ptolemaic ruler, Cleopatra VII, and Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire. Despite its relatively short existence, the Ptolemaic Kingdom had a profound impact on the history and culture of Egypt and the wider Mediterranean world.",

Under British rule, India experienced significant economic and social changes, including the introduction of modern infrastructure, such as railways, telegraphs, and postal services, as well as the establishment of a modern legal system and the spread of education. However, the British also imposed their own cultural and political values on India, leading to tensions and conflicts between the colonizers and the colonized. The British Indian Empire was also marked by significant political movements, including the Indian National Congress, which was founded in 1885 and played a key role in the struggle for Indian independence.

His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.",

Since around 1850, Europe is most commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Although the term \"continent\" implies physical geography, the land border is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity.

The modern British Army traces back to 1707, with an antecedent in the English Army that was created during the Restoration in 1660. The term British Army was adopted in 1707 after the Acts of Union between England and Scotland. Although all members of the British Army are expected to swear (or affirm) allegiance to Elizabeth II as their commander-in-chief, the Bill of Rights of 1689 requires parliamentary consent for the Crown to maintain a peacetime standing army; hence the reason it is not called the \"Royal Army\". Therefore, Parliament approves the army by passing an Armed Forces Act at least once every five years. The army is administered by the Ministry of Defence and commanded by the Chief of the General Staff. The British Army has seen action in major wars between the world's great powers, including the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War and the First and Second World Wars.

While the other conspirators failed in their attempts, Booth was successful in shooting Lincoln in the back of the head during a performance of the play \"Our American Cousin.\" After the assassination, Booth fled the scene and went into hiding. He was eventually tracked down by Union soldiers and killed in a shootout at a farm in Virginia.

It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6, bright enough to cast shadows. Because Venus is an inferior planet from Earth, it never appears to venture far from the Sun: its elongation reaches a maximum of 47.8°. Venus reaches its maximum brightness shortly before sunrise or shortly after sunset, for which reason it has been referred to by ancient cultures as the Morning Star or Evening Star. Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's \"sister planet\" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field. Venus's surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and periodically refreshed by volcanism.",

Jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Together, these four planets are sometimes referred to as the Jovian or outer planets. The planet was known by astronomers of ancient times and was associated with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures. The Romans named the planet after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium only comprises about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.

The theory challenged the prevailing belief that the Earth was the center of the universe and instead proposed that the Sun was at the center, with the Earth and other planets orbiting around it. This idea, known as the heliocentric model, was a major shift in thinking about the cosmos and had significant implications for astronomy, physics, and philosophy. Copernicus developed his theory over many years, drawing on observations of the movements of the planets and stars. He published his ideas in his book \"De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium\" (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) in 1543, just before his death. The book was initially met with skepticism and resistance, but over time it gained acceptance and became a cornerstone of modern astronomy. Copernicanism had a profound impact on the way people thought about the universe and their place in it. It challenged the idea that humans were at the center of creation and instead suggested that they were just one small part of a vast and complex system. This idea had implications for religion, philosophy, and science, and it paved the way for further discoveries and advancements in these fields. Today, Copernicanism is widely accepted as the correct model of the solar system, and it continues to inspire scientists and thinkers around the world. Its legacy can be seen in everything from space exploration to our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.",

He is best known for his work De architectura, a ten-volume treatise on architecture, engineering, and urban planning. The work is considered one of the most important works on architecture and engineering from ancient times and has been influential in the development of Western architecture. Vitruvius was born in northern Italy and served as a military engineer in the Roman army. He later worked as an architect and engineer for Julius Caesar and Augustus, the first Roman emperor. His work on De architectura was likely completed during the reign of Augustus. In De architectura, Vitruvius covers a wide range of topics related to architecture and engineering, including the design of temples, public buildings, and private homes, as well as the construction of aqueducts, roads, and bridges. He also discusses the use of materials such as marble, concrete, and wood, and provides detailed instructions on the construction of various types of machines and tools. Vitruvius believed that architecture should be based on the principles of firmitas (strength), utilitas (functionality), and venustas (beauty). He argued that a building should be designed to withstand the test of time, serve its intended purpose, and be aesthetically pleasing. Despite its importance, De architectura was largely forgotten during the Middle Ages and was only rediscovered during the Renaissance. It has since been translated into many languages and has influenced architects and engineers for centuries. Vitruvius' work remains an important source of information on ancient Roman architecture and engineering, and his ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars today.",

His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, \"Aristotle was the first genuine scientist in history ... [and] every scientist is in his debt.\" Teaching Alexander gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism. He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception. Aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works. His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues (Cicero described his literary style as \"a river of gold\"), it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one-third of the original works have survived.",

It is flat and only a few metres above sea level, as a result of an ancient erosion event. Robben Island is a South African National Heritage Site as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the end of the 17th century, Robben Island has been used for the isolation of mainly political prisoners. The Dutch settlers were the first to use Robben Island as a prison. Its first prisoner was probably Autshumato in the mid-17th century. Among its early permanent inhabitants were political leaders from various Dutch colonies, including Indonesia, and the leader of the mutiny on the slave ship Meermin. During the Second World War, the island was fortified and guns were installed as part of the defences for Cape Town. Some of the guns were still in place during the 1990s. Political prisoners were again held there between 1961 and 1991, including Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, and Jacob Zuma.

Isabelle was born in the early 1400s in Domrémy, a small village in northeastern France. She married Jacques d'Arc, a farmer and village official, and together they had five children, including Joan. Isabelle was known for her piety and devotion to the Catholic Church, and she instilled these values in her children. When Joan began to experience visions and hear voices, Isabelle was initially skeptical. However, she eventually came to believe that her daughter was on a divine mission to save France from English domination. Isabelle supported Joan's efforts to meet with the dauphin (the future King Charles VII) and convince him to allow her to lead the French army against the English. Isabelle's life was marked by tragedy. Her husband died when Joan was a teenager, leaving Isabelle to raise their children alone. After Joan was captured by the English and put on trial for heresy, Isabelle traveled to Rouen to be with her daughter. She was present at Joan's trial and witnessed her daughter's execution by burning at the stake in 1431. After Joan's death, Isabelle devoted herself to preserving her daughter's memory and reputation. She petitioned the Church to reopen Joan's case and clear her name, and she traveled to Paris to meet with King Charles VII and plead for his support. Isabelle died in 1458, still fighting to defend her daughter's legacy. Today, she is remembered as a devoted mother and a key figure in the story of Joan of Arc.",

The German libretto was originally prepared by Joseph Sonnleithner from the French of Jean-Nicolas Bouilly, with the work premiering at Vienna's Theater an der Wien on 20 November 1805. The following year, Stephan von Breuning helped shorten the work from three acts to two. After further work on the libretto by Georg Friedrich Treitschke, a final version performed at the Kärntnertortheater on 23 May 1814. By convention, both of the first two versions are referred to as Leonore. The opera tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard named \"Fidelio\", rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison. Bouilly's scenario fits Beethoven's aesthetic and political outlook: a story of personal sacrifice, heroism and eventual triumph. With its underlying struggle for liberty and justice mirroring contemporary political movements in Europe, such topics are typical of Beethoven's \"middle period\". Notable moments in the opera include the \"Prisoners' Chorus\", an ode to freedom sung by a chorus of political prisoners, Florestan's vision of Leonore come to rescue him, and the scene in which the rescue finally takes place.",
