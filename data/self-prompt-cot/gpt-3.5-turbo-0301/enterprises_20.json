Despite these challenges, Coca-Cola remains one of the most successful and recognizable brands in the world. The company has a global presence, with operations in more than 200 countries.

Overall, Coca-Cola is a cultural icon that has played a significant role in shaping the world of soft drinks and popular culture.

The company's hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, and the HomePod smart speaker. Apple's software includes the macOS and iOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store, and Mac App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell personal computers. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of its products and limited software titles caused problems, as did power struggles between executives at the company. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee, while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers with him. The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles. In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Apple introduced the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics, sparking the desktop publishing revolution. In 1991, Apple introduced the PowerBook, replacing the \"luggable\" Macintosh Portable with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the operating system, which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, and Jobs returned to Apple.",

Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market. Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it. After Wardenclyffe, Tesla went on to try to develop a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, he lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. The nature of his earlier work and the pronouncements he made to the press later in life earned him the reputation of an archetypal \"mad scientist\" in American popular culture. Tesla died in New York City in January 1943.",

The company established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. Since the 1980s, Disney has created and acquired corporate divisions in order to market more mature content than is typically associated with its flagship family-oriented brands. The company is known for its film studio division, The Walt Disney Studios, which includes Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, and Blue Sky Studios. Disney's other main divisions are Disney Media Networks, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, and Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International. Disney also owns and operates the ABC broadcast network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, Freeform, FX, and National Geographic; publishing, merchandising, music, and theater divisions; and owns and licenses a portfolio of intellectual property rights, including the Disney Princess franchise. The company has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1991. Cartoon character Mickey Mouse, created in 1928, is one of the world's most recognizable symbols and serves as the company's official mascot. In early 2020, the company had a market capitalization of $200 billion. As of September 2021, Disney is the world's second-largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue, after Comcast.

The Airbnb platform is easy to use, with hosts creating a listing for their property and travelers searching for accommodations based on their preferences and budget. Hosts can set their own prices and availability, and Airbnb takes a commission on each booking. The company also offers a range of tools and services to help hosts manage their listings, including professional photography, pricing tips, and customer support. Airbnb has faced some controversy over the years, with critics arguing that the platform contributes to rising housing costs and gentrification in some cities. The company has responded by implementing policies to address these concerns, such as limiting the number of properties that hosts can list and working with local governments to collect taxes and regulate short-term rentals. Despite these challenges, Airbnb continues to be a popular choice for travelers and hosts alike. The company has expanded beyond traditional accommodations to offer experiences and activities led by local hosts, such as cooking classes, guided tours, and outdoor adventures. With its focus on community and connection, Airbnb has become a cultural phenomenon and a symbol of the sharing economy.",

The company is based in San Francisco and has operations in over 900 metropolitan areas worldwide. It is one of the largest transportation network companies in the world. Uber was founded in 2009 by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp. The company's initial focus was on providing a platform for on-demand black car services, but it has since expanded to include a variety of transportation options. Uber's business model is based on connecting riders with drivers through a mobile app, which allows users to request a ride and track the driver's location in real-time. Uber has faced numerous controversies over the years, including accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination, regulatory challenges, and disputes with drivers over pay and working conditions. The company has also been criticized for its aggressive expansion tactics and for its treatment of drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. Despite these challenges, Uber has continued to grow and expand its services. In addition to its core ride-hailing business, the company has launched a number of new initiatives, including UberEATS, a food delivery service, and UberPOOL, a carpooling service that allows riders to share rides and split the cost. The company has also invested heavily in developing self-driving car technology, although these efforts have been slowed by a fatal accident involving one of Uber's autonomous vehicles in 2018. As of 2021, Uber operates in over 70 countries and has more than 100 million active users worldwide. The company has also expanded into other areas, including freight transportation and financial services.

As of January 31, 2021, Walmart has 10,526 stores and clubs in 24 countries, operating under 48 different names.

Walmart's strategy is to offer the lowest prices to its customers, which has led to its success in the retail industry.

Walmart also invests heavily in its employees, offering them competitive wages and benefits, and providing training and development opportunities. Walmart has faced criticism for its labor practices, including low wages, poor working conditions, and anti-union policies. The company has also been criticized for its impact on small businesses, as its low prices can make it difficult for smaller retailers to compete. Walmart has responded to these criticisms by implementing various initiatives to improve its labor practices and support small businesses. In recent years, Walmart has also focused on expanding its e-commerce business, in response to the growing trend of online shopping.

The company also provides leasing and product support services. Boeing is among the largest global aerospace manufacturers; it is the second-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2018 revenue, and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value. Boeing stock is included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Boeing was founded by William Boeing in Seattle, Washington in 1916. The company initially produced seaplanes, and later expanded into the production of military and commercial aircraft. During World War II, Boeing produced a number of military aircraft, including the B-17 Flying Fortress and the B-29 Superfortress. In the post-war era, Boeing continued to produce military aircraft, but also began to focus on commercial aviation. The company's first commercial jetliner, the 707, was introduced in 1958 and became a commercial success. Boeing has since produced a number of successful commercial aircraft, including the 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, and 787. The company has also produced a number of military aircraft, including the F-15 Eagle, F/A-18 Hornet, and AH-64 Apache. In addition to aircraft, Boeing produces a range of other products, including satellites, rockets, and telecommunications equipment. Boeing has faced a number of challenges in recent years. In 2019, the company's 737 MAX aircraft was involved in two fatal crashes, leading to the grounding of the entire fleet. The company has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation, including allegations that it prioritized profits over safety. In addition, Boeing has faced financial challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a decline in demand for air travel. Despite these challenges, Boeing remains a major player in the aerospace industry. The company has a strong reputation for innovation and has been responsible for a number of groundbreaking developments in aviation, including the first commercial jetliner and the first supersonic transport. With a history spanning over a century, Boeing is a key part of the American aerospace industry and a major contributor to the global economy.",

The company's hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, and the HomePod smart speaker. Apple's software includes the macOS and iOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store, and Mac App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of its products and limited software titles caused problems, as did power struggles between executives at the company. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee, while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers with him. The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles. In 1985, Jobs was ousted from the company by its board of directors. That same year, Apple introduced the LaserWriter, the first laser printer to be offered at a reasonable price point, and added a number of new software packages for the Macintosh. Apple's continued success during the 1990s was due to its development of the desktop publishing market, with the introduction of the LaserWriter printer, and the addition of color into the Macintosh line. The company was also successful in introducing the first consumer-level digital camera, the QuickTake, in 1994. During this time, Apple purchased several companies to create a portfolio of professional and consumer-oriented digital production software.",

In the late 1800s, he began experimenting with various ingredients to create a new kind of soda that would be refreshing and energizing. After several attempts, Pemberton finally hit upon the formula for Coca-Cola in 1886. The drink quickly became popular, and Pemberton began selling it at his drugstore. However, he soon realized that he needed to expand his business in order to meet the growing demand for Coca-Cola. In 1888, Pemberton sold the rights to Coca-Cola to a businessman named Asa Candler, who founded the Coca-Cola Company and turned the drink into a worldwide phenomenon. Pemberton continued to work on other inventions, but he never achieved the same level of success as he did with Coca-Cola. Despite his success, Pemberton's life was not without its challenges. He suffered from chronic pain due to a wound he received during the Civil War, and he struggled with addiction to morphine, which he used to manage his pain. He died in 1888, just two years after creating Coca-Cola, at the age of 57.

            "passage": "Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. The company's hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, and the HomePod smart speaker. Apple's software includes the macOS and iOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store, and Mac App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell personal computers. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of its products and limited software titles caused problems, as did power struggles between executives at the company. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee, while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers with him. The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles. In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Apple introduced the LaserWriter, the first laser printer to be offered at a reasonable price point, and added Adobe Systems' PostScript page description language to its software. With these innovations, Apple hoped to make the Macintosh the business computer of choice, but it was overtaken by IBM's PC and its clones, particularly after Microsoft introduced Windows, a graphical user interface for MS-DOS, in 1985. The Macintosh remained Apple's primary revenue generator until 1993, when the company introduced the PowerBook line of portable computers.",

NeXT was founded after Jobs was forced out of Apple, along with several co-workers. NeXT introduced the first NeXT Computer in 1988, and the smaller NeXTstation in 1990. The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, their innovative object-oriented NeXTSTEP operating system and development environment were highly influential. NeXT later released much of the NeXTSTEP system as a programming environment standard called OpenStep. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing OPENSTEP for Mach, its own OpenStep implementation, for several OEMs. NeXT also developed WebObjects, one of the first enterprise web application frameworks. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000, but it remains a prominent early example of a Web server based on dynamic page generation rather than on static content. Apple purchased NeXT in 1997 for $429 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock.

Since the bailout, AIG has undergone significant restructuring and has returned to profitability. The company has sold off many of its non-core businesses and has focused on its core insurance operations. AIG has also implemented stricter risk management practices to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis.

However, he soon realized that his true passion lay in the world of technology and entrepreneurship. In 1997, Randolph co-founded Netflix with Reed Hastings, a fellow entrepreneur. The idea for the company came about when Hastings was charged a $40 late fee for a rental of Apollo 13. The two friends saw an opportunity to create a subscription-based DVD rental service that would eliminate late fees and allow customers to keep DVDs for as long as they wanted. Randolph played a crucial role in the early days of Netflix, serving as the company's first CEO and overseeing its growth from a small startup to a major player in the entertainment industry. He was responsible for developing the company's business model, building its customer base, and securing partnerships with major studios and distributors. After leaving Netflix in 2002, Randolph went on to found several other successful startups, including Looker Data Sciences and MeeVee. He is also a sought-after speaker and mentor, sharing his expertise and insights with aspiring entrepreneurs around the world. Throughout his career, Randolph has been recognized for his contributions to the tech industry. In 2019, he was inducted into the Cable Hall of Fame, and he has received numerous other awards and honors for his work.

The system was developed by a team of IBM researchers led by David Ferrucci, and made its debut on the quiz show Jeopardy! in 2011, where it competed against two former champions and emerged victorious. Watson's success on Jeopardy! was a major milestone in the development of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Since its debut, IBM Watson has been used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and education. In healthcare, Watson has been used to help diagnose and treat cancer, while in finance it has been used to analyze market trends and make investment recommendations. In education, Watson has been used to help teachers personalize learning for their students. IBM Watson is powered by a combination of natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms. It is capable of analyzing vast amounts of data and extracting insights that would be difficult or impossible for humans to uncover. The system is also designed to learn from its interactions with humans, improving its performance over time. Despite its many successes, IBM Watson has faced criticism for its high cost and limited applicability in certain industries. Some experts have also raised concerns about the potential for bias in the system's decision-making processes. Nevertheless, IBM Watson remains one of the most advanced and widely used artificial intelligence systems in the world, and its continued development is likely to have a significant impact on a wide range of industries in the years to come.",

However, Kalanick's tenure as CEO was marked by controversy, including allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination, as well as a toxic corporate culture.

Over the years, its role in banking and the economy has expanded. Today, the Federal Reserve's duties fall into four general areas: conducting monetary policy, supervising and regulating banks and other financial institutions, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, the public, and financial institutions. The Federal Reserve System is composed of a central governmental agency in Washington, D.C. (the Board of Governors) and twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks in major cities throughout the United States. The Federal Reserve Banks are quasi-public institutions that operate independently of the federal government, but with oversight from the Board of Governors. The Federal Reserve System is considered to be an independent central bank because its decisions do not have to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.

Although the two species are similar in size and appearance, they have different social behaviors and live in different parts of Africa. Bonobos are found only in the Democratic Republic of Congo, while chimpanzees are found in several African countries. Bonobos are known for their peaceful and cooperative social behavior, which is in contrast to the more aggressive and competitive behavior of chimpanzees. Bonobos are also known for their sexual behavior, which includes frequent sexual activity between individuals of both sexes and in various combinations. Bonobos are endangered due to habitat loss and hunting, and conservation efforts are underway to protect them.",
