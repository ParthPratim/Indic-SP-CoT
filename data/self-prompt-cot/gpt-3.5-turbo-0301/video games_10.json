            "passage": "Assassin's Creed is a popular action-adventure video game series developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. The series is set in a fictional historical setting and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire control and order. The series has been praised for its immersive gameplay, historical accuracy, and engaging storyline. The first game in the series, Assassin's Creed, was released in 2007 and introduced players to the world of the Assassins and Templars. The game was set during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land and followed the story of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, an Assassin tasked with eliminating key targets in order to restore peace to the land. The game was praised for its innovative gameplay mechanics, including the use of parkour and stealth to navigate the game world. The series has since expanded to include numerous sequels and spin-offs, each set in a different historical period. Assassin's Creed II, released in 2009, introduced players to Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young Italian nobleman who becomes an Assassin after his family is betrayed and murdered. The game was set during the Italian Renaissance and featured a larger game world, more varied gameplay mechanics, and a more complex storyline. Subsequent games in the series have explored other historical periods, including the American Revolution in Assassin's Creed III, the French Revolution in Assassin's Creed Unity, and ancient Egypt in Assassin's Creed Origins. Each game has introduced new gameplay mechanics and features, such as naval combat in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and RPG elements in Assassin's Creed Odyssey. The series has also spawned numerous tie-in media, including novels, comics, and a feature film. The franchise has been praised for its attention to historical detail and its ability to bring historical periods to life in a way that is both entertaining and educational. Overall, Assassin's Creed has become one of the most popular and successful video game franchises of all time, with over 155 million copies sold as of 2021. The series has won numerous awards and accolades, including multiple Game of the Year awards, and has become a cultural phenomenon with a dedicated fanbase.",

Minecraft has a large modding community, with thousands of mods available that add new features and gameplay mechanics to the game. The game also has a multiplayer mode, allowing players to join servers and play with others from around the world. Minecraft has been praised for its creativity and educational value, with many schools using the game to teach subjects such as history, geography, and programming. The game has also been used for research purposes, such as studying how players collaborate and communicate in virtual environments. Minecraft has won numerous awards and accolades, including the BAFTA Games Award for Best Family and Social Game in 2012 and the Golden Joystick Award for Best Downloadable Game in 2011. The game has also been featured in popular culture, with references in movies, TV shows, and music. In 2014, Mojang Studios was acquired by Microsoft for $2.5 billion, and Minecraft has since been integrated into Microsoft's gaming ecosystem, including Xbox Game Pass and Minecraft Earth, a mobile augmented reality game. The game continues to receive updates and new content, with the latest major update, Caves & Cliffs, set to release in 2021.",

The series centers on an interstellar war between humanity and an alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. The Covenant, led by their religious leaders called the Prophets, worship an ancient civilization known as the Forerunners, who perished in combat with the parasitic Flood. The central focus of the franchise builds off the experiences of Master Chief John-117, one of a group of supersoldiers codenamed Spartans, and his artificial intelligence (AI) companion, Cortana. Other characters, such as Noble Six from Halo: Reach, are also introduced in the series. The term \"Halo\" refers to the Halo Array: a group of immense, habitable, ring-shaped superweapons that were created by the Forerunners to destroy the Flood, but which the Covenant mistake for religious artifacts that, if activated, would transport them on a Great Journey to meet the Forerunners. They are similar to the Orbitals in Iain M. Banks' Culture novels, and to a lesser degree to author Larry Niven's Ringworld concept. The games in the series have been praised as being among the best first-person shooters on a video game console. This success has led to novels, comics, and other media being released under the Halo brand. The franchise has also inspired numerous video game adaptations, including Halo Wars and Halo: Spartan Assault. The Halo series has sold over 77 million copies worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time. The games have also been highly influential, with elements such as the regenerating health system and the use of AI companions being adopted by other first-person shooters. The series has received critical acclaim, with the original Halo: Combat Evolved being considered one of the greatest video games of all time. The series has also been praised for its storytelling, with the relationship between Master Chief and Cortana being particularly well-received. The games have been noted for their immersive environments, with the Halo rings being described as some of the most memorable locations in video game history. The series has also been praised for its multiplayer modes, with Halo 2 being particularly well-regarded for its online play.

He was born on August 11, 1965, in Japan and began his career in the video game industry in 1990 as a planner and game designer for Capcom. Mikami's first major success came in 1996 with the release of Resident Evil, which he directed and co-wrote. The game was a critical and commercial success, and it spawned a franchise that has sold over 100 million copies worldwide. Mikami continued to work on the Resident Evil series, directing the second and fourth installments, as well as the GameCube remake of the original game. He also directed other Capcom titles, including Devil May Cry and Viewtiful Joe. In 2006, Mikami left Capcom to form his own studio, Clover Studio, which was later acquired by Capcom. He then left Capcom again in 2010 to join PlatinumGames, where he directed the critically acclaimed game, Vanquish. Mikami's games are known for their intense action, horror elements, and innovative gameplay mechanics. He has been praised for his ability to create immersive and atmospheric worlds, as well as his attention to detail and storytelling. Mikami has won numerous awards for his work, including the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards. Despite his success, Mikami has expressed frustration with the video game industry, particularly with the focus on sequels and franchises over original ideas. He has also been critical of the trend towards microtransactions and loot boxes in games. Mikami continues to work in the industry, and his next project, Ghostwire: Tokyo, is set to be released in 2022.",
