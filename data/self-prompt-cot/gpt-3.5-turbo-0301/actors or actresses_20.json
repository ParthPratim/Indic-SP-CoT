Founded in 1701 as the Collegiate School, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The Collegiate School was renamed Yale College in 1718 to honor the school's largest benefactor, Elihu Yale. Yale College became Yale University in 1887, when it was renamed in recognition of a gift from the philanthropist John William Sterling. The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the professional schools. Yale has a strong tradition of undergraduate education, with over 5,000 undergraduate students and a student-to-faculty ratio of 6:1. The university is known for its strong programs in law, business, medicine, and the humanities, and is consistently ranked among the top universities in the world. Yale has produced numerous notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, and many foreign heads of state.",

The film tells the story of Leopold, a 19th-century Duke who time travels to modern-day New York City and falls in love with Kate, a successful businesswoman. The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success, grossing over $76 million worldwide. The film's plot revolves around the concept of time travel and the clash of cultures between the 19th and 21st centuries. Leopold, played by Jackman, is a charming and chivalrous Duke who is transported to modern-day New York City through a time portal. He is initially bewildered by the modern world and its technology, but soon adapts and begins to explore the city. Kate, played by Ryan, is a successful marketing executive who is skeptical of love and romance. She meets Leopold by chance and is initially put off by his old-fashioned manners and beliefs. However, as they spend more time together, she begins to see the charm and sincerity in his ways. The film's supporting cast includes Liev Schreiber as Stuart, Kate's ex-boyfriend and a scientist who discovers the time portal, and Breckin Meyer as Charlie, Kate's younger brother who becomes friends with Leopold. Kate & Leopold was praised for its performances, particularly Jackman's portrayal of Leopold. The film also received criticism for its predictable plot and lack of originality.

Dead Man's Bones is known for their unique sound, which combines elements of indie rock, folk, and doo-wop with eerie, haunting vocals and lyrics that often explore themes of death and the afterlife. The band's self-titled debut album was released in 2009 to critical acclaim. The album features a full choir and a children's choir, giving it a haunting, ethereal quality. The songs on the album range from upbeat and catchy to slow and mournful, with lyrics that often reference ghosts, skeletons, and other spooky imagery. In addition to their music, Dead Man's Bones is also known for their elaborate live shows, which often feature elaborate sets and costumes. The band has performed at a number of high-profile events, including the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Sundance Film Festival. Despite their success, Dead Man's Bones has remained relatively low-key over the years. Gosling and Shields have both continued to pursue their acting and music careers separately, but have occasionally reunited to perform together.
