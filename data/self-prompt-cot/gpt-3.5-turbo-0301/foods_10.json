As one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion in 2011, there are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs. Chickens are believed to have been domesticated from the red junglefowl in Southeast Asia more than 10,000 years ago. They were first brought to Europe by the Romans, and later to the Americas by European explorers. Today, chickens are found all over the world, in a wide variety of breeds and colors. Chickens are omnivores, eating a diet that includes grains, insects, and small animals. They are social animals, living in groups called flocks, and have a complex social hierarchy. Roosters, or male chickens, are known for their distinctive crowing, which they use to establish their dominance over other males and to attract females. Chickens are also known for their ability to lay eggs, which are a rich source of protein and other nutrients. Hens, or female chickens, can lay up to 300 eggs per year, depending on the breed. Eggs are used in a wide variety of dishes, from breakfast omelets to baked goods. In addition to their role as a food source, chickens are also used for their feathers, which are used in clothing and other products, and for their manure, which is used as fertilizer. Chickens are also sometimes kept as pets, particularly in urban areas where space is limited. Despite their widespread use and popularity, chickens face a number of challenges, including disease, predation, and poor living conditions in some commercial operations. Animal welfare advocates have called for improved conditions for chickens, including more space, better ventilation, and access to the outdoors.

They are a diverse group of animals, with over 34,000 species identified so far. Fish are cold-blooded, meaning that their body temperature is regulated by the temperature of the water around them. They breathe through gills, which extract oxygen from the water, and most fish have scales that protect their skin and help them swim. Fish come in many different shapes and sizes, from tiny minnows to massive whale sharks. They can be found in freshwater or saltwater, and some species can even survive in both. Fish play an important role in the ecosystem, serving as both predator and prey. They are a major food source for humans and other animals, and many species are also kept as pets. Fish are divided into two main groups: bony fish and cartilaginous fish. Bony fish, which make up the majority of fish species, have a skeleton made of bone and a swim bladder that helps them control their buoyancy. Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks and rays, have a skeleton made of cartilage and do not have a swim bladder. Fish have a variety of adaptations that help them survive in their aquatic environments. Some fish have specialized organs that allow them to produce and detect electric fields, which they use to navigate and communicate with other fish. Others have evolved the ability to change color or shape to blend in with their surroundings or to attract mates. Despite their importance, many fish populations are threatened by overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these important animals and their habitats.",

            "passage": "A hamburger, also known as a burger, is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan-fried, grilled, smoked or flame-broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or \"special sauce\"; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger. The term \"burger\" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the UK where the term \"patty\" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. The term may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in \"turkey burger\", \"bison burger\", or \"veggie burger\". The hamburger originated in the late 19th or early 20th century. The modern hamburger was a product of the culinary needs of a society rapidly changing due to industrialization, the emergence of the working class and middle class and the demand for mass-produced, affordable food that could be consumed outside of the home. The hamburger became popular in the United States and Canada, and has become a staple in the fast food industry. The world's largest hamburger weighed 2,014 pounds (914 kg) and was cooked in 2012 in Carlton, Minnesota, US. The hamburger was 10 feet (3.05 m) in diameter and took over 15 hours to cook. The largest commercially available hamburger weighed 777 pounds (352 kg) and was prepared by Black Bear Casino Resort in Carlton, Minnesota, US in 2017. Hamburgers are a popular food item in fast food restaurants, diners, and bars. They are also a common menu item in many restaurants that serve American cuisine. Hamburgers have become a symbol of American culture and are often associated with backyard barbecues, Fourth of July celebrations, and fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.",

It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other flavorings. Ice cream can be served in a variety of forms, including cones, cups, and bars. The origins of ice cream can be traced back to ancient China, where a mixture of milk and rice was frozen in snow. The first recorded instance of ice cream being served in Europe was in the 16th century, when Italian chefs created a frozen dessert made from cream, sugar, and fruit. In the United States, ice cream became popular in the late 19th century, with the invention of the hand-cranked ice cream maker. This device allowed people to make ice cream at home, and it quickly became a staple of American cuisine. Today, ice cream is enjoyed all over the world, with a wide variety of flavors and styles available. Some popular flavors include vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and mint chocolate chip. Ice cream can also be made with non-dairy ingredients, such as soy milk or coconut milk, for those who are lactose intolerant or vegan. In addition to being a delicious treat, ice cream has also been the subject of scientific research. Scientists have studied the properties of ice cream, including its texture, melting rate, and ability to resist melting. This research has led to the development of new types of ice cream, such as low-fat and low-sugar varieties. Overall, ice cream is a beloved dessert that has been enjoyed for centuries.

Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by area. The country is officially divided into 23 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. China emerged as one of the world's earliest civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-legendary Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty, which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa. The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. In the late 19th century, the Qing dynasty was overthrown following the Boxer Rebellion, which was itself crushed by an international alliance led by the Eight-Nation Alliance. The establishment of the Republic of China in 1912 led to the Chinese Civil War and the division of China into the two political entities of the PRC and the ROC. The PRC is a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of China, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. The PRC also claims Taiwan – which is controlled by the ROC – as its 23rd province, a claim controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan and the unresolved Chinese Civil War.",

Hens are social animals and prefer to live in groups called flocks. They are known for their distinctive clucking sound and can communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations. Hens are omnivores and will eat a variety of foods including grains, insects, and small animals. They are also known for their ability to scratch and peck at the ground, which helps to aerate the soil and control pests. Hens are commonly raised on farms for their eggs, which are a rich source of protein and other nutrients. They are also used for meat production, with some breeds being specifically bred for this purpose. Hens are popular pets and can be kept in backyard coops by hobbyists.

Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 solar days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.256 times. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, with small amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases. The atmospheric pressure varies at different layers and is about 1 atm at sea level. Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere, oceans, and other abiotic factors, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful solar radiation, permitting life on land.

Although the term \"continent\" implies physical geography, the land border is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity.

It is also used in fillings, medicines, sweets, as a stabilizer in fruit juices and milk drinks, and as a source of dietary fiber. Pectin is a complex mixture of polysaccharides, mainly composed of galacturonic acid, with smaller amounts of other sugars such as rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose. The degree of esterification (DE) of pectin is an important factor in determining its gelling properties. Pectin with a high DE forms a weak gel, whereas pectin with a low DE forms a strong gel.
