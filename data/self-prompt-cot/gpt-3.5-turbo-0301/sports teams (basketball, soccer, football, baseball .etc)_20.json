The Celtics have continued to be a competitive team in the modern era, with players such as Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen leading the team to another championship in 2008. The team has also had success in recent years with the emergence of young stars such as Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Off the court, the Celtics have a rich history of social activism and community involvement. The team was the first in the NBA to draft a black player, Chuck Cooper, in 1950, and has been a leader in promoting racial equality and social justice.

Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the team has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception. The word Real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed upon the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Real Madrid is one of the most successful clubs in European football history, having won a record 13 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, as well as a record 34 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey titles, and 11 Supercopa de España titles. In international football, they have also won four FIFA Club World Cup titles and three Intercontinental Cups, among other trophies. The club was initially formed by a group of football enthusiasts led by Julián Palacios, a local businessman, and Juan Padrós, a former player for Athletic Bilbao. The team played its first official match on 13 May 1902 against FC Barcelona, which ended in a 3-1 victory for Madrid. The club's first major success came in 1905 when they won the Copa del Rey, the first of many domestic and international titles to follow. Real Madrid's most successful period came in the 1950s and 1960s, when they won five consecutive European Cups between 1956 and 1960, and another in 1966. This period also saw the emergence of legendary players such as Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, and Francisco Gento, who helped establish the club as a dominant force in world football. In recent years, Real Madrid has continued to be a major force in European football, winning four of the last six Champions League titles between 2014 and 2018. The club has also continued to attract some of the world's best players, including Cristiano Ronaldo, who won four Champions League titles and two Ballon d'Or awards during his time at the club. Real Madrid is owned by its members, who elect a president to oversee the club's operations. The current president is Florentino Pérez, who has overseen the club's recent success and has been instrumental in the signing of high-profile players such as Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, and Eden Hazard.",

The High Line, a 1.45-mile-long elevated park built on an abandoned railroad track, runs through the neighborhood from Gansevoort Street to 34th Street. The park has become a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, offering views of the Hudson River and the city skyline. Chelsea is also home to several historic landmarks, including the Chelsea Hotel, which has been a residence for artists, writers, and musicians since the early 20th century. Other notable landmarks include the General Theological Seminary, the London Terrace Apartments, and the Chelsea Market, a food hall and shopping center housed in the former National Biscuit Company factory. The neighborhood has a diverse population, with a mix of young professionals, artists, and families. The area has seen significant gentrification in recent years, with the influx of new residents and businesses driving up property values and rents.

            "passage": "The New York Yankees are a professional baseball team based in the Bronx borough of New York City. They compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The team was founded in 1901 as the Baltimore Orioles and moved to New York City in 1903, becoming known as the New York Highlanders before being officially renamed the \"Yankees\" in 1913. The Yankees have won 27 World Series championships, the most in MLB history, and 40 American League pennants. The team has had many iconic players throughout its history, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Derek Jeter. The team's success has made them one of the most popular and valuable franchises in all of sports. The Yankees play their home games at Yankee Stadium, which opened in 2009 and replaced the original Yankee Stadium, which was built in 1923. The new stadium is located across the street from the old one and features many modern amenities, including a high-definition video board and a museum dedicated to the team's history. The team's colors are navy blue and white, and their logo features the interlocking letters \"NY.\" The team's uniform has remained largely unchanged since the 1930s, with the exception of minor tweaks to the design. The Yankees have a fierce rivalry with the Boston Red Sox, which dates back to the early 20th century. The two teams have faced each other in many memorable games and playoff series, including the 2003 American League Championship Series, which featured a dramatic walk-off home run by Aaron Boone in the 11th inning of Game 7. The team's ownership group is led by Hal Steinbrenner, the son of longtime owner George Steinbrenner. The team's general manager is Brian Cashman, who has been with the team since 1998 and has overseen many successful seasons. Despite their success, the Yankees have faced criticism for their high payroll and perceived arrogance. However, the team's fans remain fiercely loyal and passionate, and the Yankees continue to be one of the most iconic and successful franchises in all of sports.",

In recent years, the Dodgers have been one of the most successful teams in baseball, winning seven consecutive National League West titles from 2013 to 2019. They have also made two World Series appearances during that time, losing to the Houston Astros in 2017 and defeating the Tampa Bay Rays in 2020.

The team was founded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots and joined the American Football League (AFL) in 1960. The Patriots joined the National Football League (NFL) as part of the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. The team has played its home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts since 2002. The Patriots have won six Super Bowl championships, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most in NFL history. The team has also won 11 conference championships and 21 division championships. The Patriots have had 19 players and coaches inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, including quarterback Tom Brady, head coach Bill Belichick, and owner Robert Kraft. The Patriots' success in the 21st century has been largely attributed to the partnership between Brady and Belichick. Brady, who was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft, has been the team's starting quarterback since 2001. Belichick, who was hired as the team's head coach in 2000, has led the Patriots to nine Super Bowl appearances and six championships. The Patriots' success has not been without controversy, however. The team was involved in the \"Spygate\" scandal in 2007, in which the team was caught videotaping the signals of the New York Jets' defensive coaches during a game. The team was fined $250,000 and Belichick was fined $500,000, the largest fine ever imposed on a coach in NFL history. The team was also stripped of a first-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. The Patriots were also involved in the \"Deflategate\" scandal in 2015, in which the team was accused of deflating footballs during the AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts. Brady was suspended for four games and the team was fined $1 million and stripped of two draft picks. Despite the controversies, the Patriots remain one of the most successful and popular teams in the NFL. The team has a large and dedicated fan base, known as \"Patriots Nation,\" and has consistently been one of the top-selling teams in terms of merchandise.",

He played point guard for the Lakers for 13 seasons. After winning championships in high school and college, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers. He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game, winning the All-Star MVP Award. After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 37, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time. Johnson's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards, nine NBA Finals appearances, twelve All-Star games, and ten All-NBA First and Second Team nominations. He led the league in regular-season assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game, at 11.2. Johnson was a member of the \"Dream Team\", the U.S. basketball team that won the Olympic gold medal in 1992. Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. Johnson became a two-time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame—being enshrined in 2002 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as a member of the \"Dream Team\". He was rated the greatest NBA point guard of all time by ESPN in 2007. His friendship and rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA finals and three NBA championship series, are well documented. Since his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and safe sex, as well as an entrepreneur, philanthropist and motivational speaker.",

He considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as trencadís which used waste ceramic pieces. Under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, Gaudí became part of the Modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream Modernisme, culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms. Gaudí rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and molding the details as he conceived them.",

The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York, flows through the Hudson Valley, and eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean, between New York City and Jersey City. The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York at its southern end. The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary, occupying the Hudson Fjord, which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation, estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago. Tidal waters influence the Hudson's flow from as far north as the city of Troy. The river is named after Henry Hudson, an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company, who explored it in 1609, and after whom Canada's Hudson Bay is also named.

Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. The NFL agreed to merge with the American Football League (AFL) in 1966, and the first Super Bowl was held at the end of that season; the merger was completed in 1970.
