            "passage": "The United States of America, commonly known as the United States or simply America, is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million, the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world (after China and India). The capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York City. Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783, leading to independence. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories, displacing Native American tribes, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery. By the end of the century, the United States had extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower. The country accounts for approximately 25% of global GDP and is the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The country ranks highly in measures of economic freedom, quality of life, education, and human development.",

It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east, and is separated from the Korean Peninsula by the Korea Strait. The country consists of four main islands, Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, as well as numerous smaller islands. Japan has a population of approximately 126 million people, making it the 11th most populous country in the world. Japan has a rich history and culture that dates back thousands of years. The country was first inhabited by the Jomon people, who lived in Japan from around 14,000 BC to 300 BC. They were followed by the Yayoi people, who introduced rice cultivation and metalworking to Japan. In the 8th century, Japan adopted Buddhism from China, which had a profound impact on Japanese culture and society. During the Edo period (1603-1868), Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa shogunate, a feudal military government that enforced strict isolationist policies. However, in the late 19th century, Japan underwent a period of rapid modernization and industrialization, which culminated in its emergence as a major world power in the early 20th century. Japan's modern history has been marked by a number of significant events, including its defeat in World War II and subsequent occupation by Allied forces, its post-war economic miracle, and its emergence as a global leader in technology and innovation. Today, Japan is known for its unique blend of traditional and modern culture, as well as its cutting-edge technology, fashion, and cuisine. The country is home to numerous UNESCO World Heritage sites, including the historic monuments of ancient Kyoto and the sacred island of Itsukushima. Japan is also renowned for its vibrant pop culture, which includes anime, manga, and video games. The country has produced a number of internationally acclaimed artists, writers, and filmmakers, including Hayao Miyazaki, Haruki Murakami, and Akira Kurosawa. Despite its many achievements, Japan faces a number of challenges, including an aging population, a declining birth rate, and ongoing tensions with neighboring countries. However, the country remains a major economic and cultural force in the world, and is widely regarded as one of the most advanced and innovative societies on the planet.",

With over 100 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Arab world, the third-most populous in Africa (after Nigeria and Ethiopia), and the fifteenth-most populous in the world. The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000 square kilometers (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land is found. The large regions of the Sahara Desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta. Egypt is famous for its ancient civilization and some of the world's most famous monuments, including the Giza pyramid complex and its Great Sphinx. The southern city of Luxor contains numerous ancient artifacts, such as the Karnak Temple and the Valley of the Kings. Egypt is widely regarded as an important political and cultural nation of the Middle East. Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal, oil, natural gas, and hydro power. Substantial coal deposits are in the northeast Sinai, and are mined at the rate of about 600,000 metric tons (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons) per year. Natural gas is a major export, especially to Europe. Egypt also has substantial renewable energy resources, including solar and wind power. Egypt is a founding member of the United Nations, Non-Aligned Movement, Arab League, African Union, and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. With a semi-presidential republic governance structure, Egypt has been ranked as a \"flawed democracy\" according to the Democracy Index. The country's current political system was established following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak.

It is bordered by Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan to the north, Afghanistan and Pakistan to the east, and Iraq and Turkey to the west. The Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman lie to the south of Iran. With a population of over 83 million people, Iran is the world's 18th most populous country. Iran has a rich history and culture that dates back thousands of years. The country was once known as Persia and was home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, the Persian Empire. Iran has been ruled by various dynasties throughout its history, including the Achaemenid Empire, the Parthian Empire, and the Sassanian Empire. In the 7th century, Islam was introduced to Iran and has since become the dominant religion in the country. Iran is known for its diverse landscapes, which range from deserts to mountains to forests. The country is also home to many important historical sites, including the ancient ruins of Persepolis and the city of Isfahan, which is known for its stunning Islamic architecture. Iran is a major player in the global oil market and has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves. The country's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, which account for a significant portion of its GDP. However, Iran has faced economic sanctions from the international community due to its nuclear program, which has limited its ability to export oil and other goods. Iran is a theocratic republic, with ultimate authority resting with the Supreme Leader, who is the highest-ranking political and religious figure in the country. The President is the head of government and is responsible for implementing policies and managing the economy. The Iranian parliament, known as the Majlis, is responsible for passing laws and overseeing the government. Iran has been involved in several conflicts in recent years, including the Syrian Civil War and the Yemeni Civil War. The country has also been accused of supporting terrorist groups, which has led to tensions with the United States and other Western countries. Despite its challenges, Iran remains a culturally rich and historically significant country. Its people are known for their hospitality and warmth, and its cuisine is considered some of the best in the world. With its strategic location and vast natural resources, Iran is poised to play an important role in the global economy and politics for years to come.",

Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by area. The country is officially divided into 23 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. China emerged as one of the world's earliest civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-legendary Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty, which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa. The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. In the late 19th century, the Qing dynasty was overthrown following the Boxer Rebellion, which was itself crushed by an international alliance led by the Eight-Nation Alliance. The establishment of the Republic of China in 1912 led to the Chinese Civil War and the division of China into the two political entities of the PRC and the ROC. The PRC is a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of China, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. The PRC also claims Taiwan – which is controlled by the ROC – as its 23rd province, a claim controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan and the unresolved Chinese Civil War.",

However, tensions between the two communities still exist, and there are occasional outbreaks of violence.

He later became editor of The Spectator magazine, a position he held from 1999 to 2005. In 2001, Johnson was elected to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for Henley. He served in various positions in the Conservative Party, including Shadow Minister for Higher Education and Shadow Minister for the Arts. In 2008, Johnson was elected Mayor of London, defeating incumbent Ken Livingstone. As Mayor, Johnson implemented a number of policies aimed at improving transportation, reducing crime, and promoting economic growth. He oversaw the introduction of the London Cycle Hire scheme, which allowed people to rent bicycles for short journeys around the city. He also introduced the New Routemaster bus, which was designed to be more environmentally friendly and accessible for disabled passengers. In 2016, Johnson became a leading figure in the campaign for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. He was a prominent member of the Vote Leave campaign and was widely seen as one of the key figures in the successful Brexit campaign. Following the referendum, Johnson was appointed as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in Theresa May's government. In July 2019, Johnson was elected leader of the Conservative Party, succeeding Theresa May as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He has since faced a number of challenges, including the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, Johnson remains a popular figure among many Conservative Party supporters and is known for his charismatic personality and unconventional approach to politics.",

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, and his influence on Western classical music is immeasurable. Beethoven was born in Bonn, Germany in 1770, and showed prodigious musical talent from a young age. He studied with some of the leading musicians of his time, including Christian Gottlob Neefe and Joseph Haydn. Beethoven's early works were heavily influenced by the Classical style of Haydn and Mozart, but he soon began to develop his own unique voice. His music became more complex and emotionally charged, and he experimented with new forms and structures. Beethoven's most famous works include his nine symphonies, his five piano concertos, and his opera Fidelio. Beethoven's personal life was marked by tragedy and struggle. He suffered from hearing loss from a young age, and by his mid-thirties he was almost completely deaf. Despite this, he continued to compose and perform, using a special rod attached to his piano to feel the vibrations of the music. Beethoven also struggled with his health, and his final years were marked by illness and isolation. Despite these challenges, Beethoven's music continued to inspire and captivate audiences long after his death in 1827. His legacy has been celebrated by countless musicians and music lovers, and his influence can be heard in the works of countless composers who followed in his footsteps.

The Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine. Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World.

It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. The Renaissance's intellectual basis was its own invented version of humanism, derived from the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that \"Man is the measure of all things.\" This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete. Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe. As a cultural movement, it encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term \"Renaissance man\".",

The CPC is the sole governing party within mainland China, permitting only eight other, subordinated parties to co-exist, those making up the United Front. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, leading to the establishment of the PRC. The CPC is officially organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the National Congress, which is theoretically held every five years. When the National Congress is not in session, the Central Committee is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party's leader holds the offices of General Secretary (usually the highest-ranking official) and President (informally termed the \"Paramount Leader\"). Since its founding, the CPC has followed Mao Zedong's thought of Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory. The CPC is committed to communism and continues to participate in the International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties each year. According to the party constitution, the CPC adheres to Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, socialism with Chinese characteristics, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The official explanation for China's economic reforms is that the country is in the primary stage of socialism, a developmental stage similar to the capitalist mode of production. The command economy established under Mao Zedong was replaced by the socialist market economy, the current economic system, on the basis that \"Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth\".",

The empire was the largest political entity to have existed in the Indian subcontinent, spanning over 5 million square kilometres at its zenith under Ashoka. It declined for about 50 years after Ashoka's rule ended, and it dissolved in 185 BCE with the foundation of the Shunga dynasty in Magadha. Under Chandragupta and his successors, internal and external trade, agriculture, and economic activities all thrived and expanded across India thanks to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance, administration, and security. After the Kalinga War, the Empire experienced nearly half a century of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of the sciences and of knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across all of India.",

The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. For about 60,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups. After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the 1850s most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories.",

During his presidency, Mubarak maintained Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, which was signed in 1979, and pursued a policy of economic liberalization and privatization. However, his regime was criticized for its human rights abuses, corruption, and lack of political freedom. In 2011, a popular uprising against Mubarak's rule erupted in Egypt, fueled by frustration with his authoritarianism, economic inequality, and corruption. After 18 days of protests, Mubarak resigned on February 11, 2011, and handed power to the military. He was subsequently put on trial for corruption and complicity in the killing of protesters during the uprising. In 2012, he was sentenced to life in prison, but the verdict was overturned on appeal.

El-Sisi graduated from the Egyptian Military Academy in 1977 and went on to receive further military training in the United States and the United Kingdom. He served in various positions in the Egyptian Armed Forces, including as the Director of Military Intelligence and the Minister of Defense. El-Sisi rose to prominence during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, which led to the ousting of President Hosni Mubarak. He was appointed as the head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which governed Egypt during the transitional period. In 2012, he was appointed as the Minister of Defense by President Mohamed Morsi. In 2013, el-Sisi led a military coup that ousted Morsi from power. He then became the de facto leader of Egypt and was later elected as the President in 2014. El-Sisi's presidency has been marked by a crackdown on political dissent and human rights abuses. He has been accused of suppressing opposition voices, jailing journalists and activists, and using excessive force against protesters. Despite criticism from human rights organizations, el-Sisi remains popular among many Egyptians who see him as a strong leader who can restore stability to the country. He has implemented economic reforms and launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including the construction of a new administrative capital city. El-Sisi has also played a key role in regional politics, particularly in the ongoing conflict in Libya. El-Sisi's presidency has been controversial, with some accusing him of authoritarianism and others praising him for his efforts to modernize Egypt.

For example, the 18th century is often associated with the Enlightenment and the rise of modern science, while the 20th century is known for its world wars, technological advancements, and social revolutions.
