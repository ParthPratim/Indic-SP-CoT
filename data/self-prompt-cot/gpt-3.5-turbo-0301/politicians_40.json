A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American to serve as president. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School. He began his political career as a community organizer before becoming a civil rights attorney. He then served in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004, and in the United States Senate from 2005 to 2008. Obama's presidential campaign in 2008 focused on issues such as healthcare reform, climate change, and ending the Iraq War. He defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, winning 365 electoral votes to McCain's 173. Obama was re-elected in 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney. As president, Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which expanded access to healthcare for millions of Americans. He also signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which aimed to prevent another financial crisis like the one that occurred in 2008. Obama's foreign policy focused on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he oversaw the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. He also worked to improve relations with Cuba and Iran, and negotiated the Paris Agreement on climate change. After leaving office, Obama has continued to be involved in politics and social issues. He founded the Obama Foundation, which aims to inspire and empower the next generation of leaders. He has also been a vocal advocate for gun control, immigration reform, and racial justice. Obama's presidency was marked by both accomplishments and challenges, and his legacy continues to be debated. However, he remains a highly respected figure in American politics and around the world.",

Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election, which she lost to Donald Trump. Born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1973.

She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978, and became the first female partner at Rose Law Firm the following year. As First Lady of Arkansas, she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas's public schools. As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an advocate for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female senator from New York. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama. During her tenure as Secretary of State, Clinton advocated the U.S. pivot to Asia, helped negotiate a ceasefire in the Gaza War, and negotiated the Iran nuclear deal. She also led the response to the Arab Spring and advocated for the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. Clinton unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, but won the popular vote by nearly three million votes.

Prior to his presidency, he was known for his real estate empire and his role as the host of the reality television show The Apprentice. Trump was born and raised in Queens, New York City, and earned an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He took over his father's real estate business in 1971 and expanded it into a global empire, with properties in New York City, Atlantic City, Florida, and other locations around the world. He also became a prominent figure in the entertainment industry, owning the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants. In 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president of the United States, running as a Republican. He campaigned on a platform of economic nationalism, promising to bring back jobs to the United States and to renegotiate trade deals that he believed were unfair to American workers. He also promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to curb illegal immigration. Despite facing controversy throughout his campaign, including accusations of racism and sexism, Trump won the 2016 presidential election, defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. During his presidency, he implemented a number of controversial policies, including a travel ban on citizens of several Muslim-majority countries, a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and a tax overhaul that primarily benefited corporations and the wealthy. Trump's presidency was marked by numerous scandals and controversies, including an ongoing investigation into his campaign's alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election, his impeachment by the House of Representatives in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in over 500,000 deaths in the United States. Despite his tumultuous presidency, Trump remains a popular figure among many conservative Americans, who view him as a champion of their values and a defender of their interests. He continues to be a prominent voice in the Republican Party and has not ruled out the possibility of running for president again in 2024.",

He was born on November 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and grew up in a Catholic family. Biden attended the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council. He was first elected to the United States Senate in 1972, at the age of 29, becoming the sixth-youngest senator in American history. During his time in the Senate, Biden served as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Judiciary Committee. He was a leading advocate for arms control, environmental protection, and civil rights. Biden was also a strong supporter of the Violence Against Women Act, which he authored and helped pass in 1994. In 2008, Biden was selected by then-Senator Barack Obama as his running mate in the presidential election. The Obama-Biden ticket won the election, and Biden was sworn in as Vice President on January 20, 2009. During his time in office, Biden played a key role in the Obama administration's efforts to pass the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which aimed to stimulate the economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Biden was also a strong advocate for LGBT rights and played a key role in the administration's decision to repeal the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy. He was also a vocal supporter of the Paris climate agreement and worked to strengthen the United States' relationships with its allies around the world. In 2015, Biden announced that he would not seek the Democratic nomination for president in the 2016 election, citing the recent death of his son Beau. However, he remained active in politics and continued to speak out on issues such as gun control and income inequality. In 2020, Biden announced his candidacy for president, and after a hard-fought primary campaign, he secured the Democratic nomination. In the general election, he faced incumbent President Donald Trump, and after a contentious and closely watched race, Biden was declared the winner on November 7, 2020. Biden's presidency has been marked by a focus on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. He has also made efforts to address climate change, racial inequality, and economic recovery.",

She is a member of the Democratic Party and has represented California's 12th congressional district since 1987. Pelosi is the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House and is the highest-ranking female politician in American history. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Pelosi attended Trinity College in Washington, D.C. before moving to San Francisco, California with her husband, Paul Pelosi. In San Francisco, Pelosi became involved in local politics and was elected as a member of the Democratic National Committee in 1976. She was elected to the House of Representatives in a special election in 1987 and has been re-elected every two years since then. Pelosi has been a vocal advocate for progressive policies throughout her career. She has been a strong supporter of women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and environmental protection. Pelosi was a key figure in the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which expanded access to healthcare for millions of Americans. She has also been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump and has led efforts to investigate his administration's actions. As Speaker of the House, Pelosi has been responsible for leading the Democratic Party's legislative agenda. She has overseen the passage of several major pieces of legislation, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which provided economic relief to Americans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Pelosi has also been a strong advocate for voting rights and has pushed for the passage of the For the People Act, which would expand access to voting and reduce the influence of money in politics. Pelosi's leadership style has been described as both tough and effective. She is known for her ability to whip votes and get legislation passed, even in the face of opposition from Republicans. Pelosi has also been praised for her ability to work across the aisle and find common ground with Republicans on certain issues. Despite her many accomplishments, Pelosi has also faced criticism from some quarters. Some progressives have accused her of being too moderate and not doing enough to push for more radical policies. Others have criticized her for being too partisan and not doing enough to work with Republicans. Overall, however, Pelosi's legacy is one of accomplishment and leadership. She has been a trailblazer for women in politics and has been a tireless advocate for progressive policies. As Speaker of the House, she has been a powerful force for change and has helped to shape the direction of American politics for decades to come.",

He is a member of the Republican Party and is known for his conservative views and advocacy for limited government, free markets, and individual liberty. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to a Cuban father and an American mother. He graduated from Princeton University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy and then attended Harvard Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor in 1995. After law school, Cruz clerked for Judge J. Michael Luttig of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and then for Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the United States Supreme Court. Cruz began his political career as a domestic policy advisor to President George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. He later served as Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008, where he argued several high-profile cases before the Supreme Court. In 2012, Cruz ran for the U.S. Senate seat in Texas and won the Republican primary against the incumbent Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst.

Born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1949, Warren attended George Washington University and earned a law degree from Rutgers Law School. She began her career as a law professor at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, and Harvard Law School. In the early 2000s, Warren became a prominent advocate for consumer protection and financial regulation. She served as the chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel, which oversaw the implementation of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in response to the 2008 financial crisis. She also helped establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a federal agency that regulates financial institutions and protects consumers from predatory lending practices. In 2012, Warren ran for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts and defeated incumbent Republican Scott Brown. She has since been reelected twice, in 2018 and 2020. As a senator, Warren has focused on issues such as income inequality, student loan debt, and healthcare. She has proposed a wealth tax on the wealthiest Americans, which she argues would raise revenue to fund social programs and reduce economic inequality. Warren has also been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump and his administration. She was one of the first Democrats to call for Trump's impeachment, and she has been a frequent target of his attacks on social media. In the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Warren was one of the frontrunners for the nomination, but ultimately dropped out of the race after disappointing results in early primary contests. Throughout her career, Warren has been recognized for her advocacy on behalf of consumers and working families. She has received numerous awards and honors, including the Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award, the National Women's History Museum's Women Making History Award, and the AFL-CIO's Government Service Award.",

He is a member of the Republican Party and has been the Senate Majority Leader since 2015. McConnell is known for his conservative views and his ability to navigate the complex political landscape of Washington, D.C.\n\nBorn in Sheffield, Alabama in 1942, McConnell grew up in Louisville, Kentucky. He attended the University of Louisville and graduated with a degree in political science in 1964. After college, McConnell worked as an intern for Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky and later served as a staff assistant for Senator Marlow Cook. In 1977, McConnell was elected to the Jefferson County Judge/Executive, a position he held for eight years. He was then elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984, defeating incumbent Democrat Walter Dee Huddleston. McConnell has since been re-elected five times, most recently in 2020. As a senator, McConnell has been a staunch conservative and has been a vocal opponent of many Democratic policies. He has been a strong advocate for limited government, lower taxes, and a strong national defense. McConnell has also been a vocal opponent of abortion and has supported efforts to restrict access to the procedure. In addition to his work in the Senate, McConnell has also been involved in Republican Party politics. He served as the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee from 1998 to 2000 and as the chairman of the Republican National Committee from 2001 to 2003.

Despite his successes, McConnell has also faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.

Overall, McConnell is a powerful and influential figure in American politics. His conservative views and political savvy have made him a force to be reckoned with in Washington, D.C. and he is likely to continue to play a major role in shaping the future of the Republican Party and the country as a whole.",

Born on December 6, 1957, in Queens, New York, Cuomo is the son of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo and the brother of CNN journalist Chris Cuomo. He graduated from Fordham University in 1979 and received his law degree from Albany Law School in 1982. Cuomo began his political career as an assistant district attorney in New York City before serving as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton from 1997 to 2001. In 2006, he was elected as the Attorney General of New York, a position he held until his election as governor in 2010. As governor, Cuomo focused on a number of key issues, including economic development, education reform, and healthcare. He implemented a number of policies aimed at improving the state's economy, including tax cuts for businesses and a $1 billion investment in the Buffalo Billion program to revitalize the upstate economy. He also championed the passage of the Marriage Equality Act in 2011, which legalized same-sex marriage in New York. Cuomo's tenure as governor was not without controversy, however. In 2014, he faced criticism for his handling of the Ebola outbreak in New York City, and in 2018, he faced allegations of sexual harassment from several women, including former aides. In 2020, Cuomo faced further criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, particularly with regard to nursing home deaths. Despite these controversies, Cuomo remained a popular figure in New York politics for much of his tenure as governor. He was reelected in 2014 and 2018, and was widely considered a potential candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. However, his political fortunes took a dramatic turn in 2021, when he faced a series of scandals and controversies that ultimately led to his resignation as governor in August of that year. Cuomo's legacy as governor of New York remains a subject of debate and controversy. While he is credited with a number of significant accomplishments during his tenure, including the legalization of same-sex marriage and the revitalization of the upstate economy, his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the allegations of sexual harassment have tarnished his reputation in the eyes of many.",

            "passage": "Gavin Christopher Newsom is an American politician and businessman who currently serves as the 40th governor of California. Born on October 10, 1967, in San Francisco, California, Newsom grew up in a politically active family. His father, William Newsom, was a state appeals court judge, and his mother, Tessa Newsom, was involved in various community organizations. Newsom attended Redwood High School in Marin County and went on to study political science at Santa Clara University. After college, he worked in the hospitality industry, managing a wine store and a series of restaurants in San Francisco. In 1996, he opened his own business, the PlumpJack Group, which included a wine shop, a hotel, and several restaurants. Newsom's political career began in 1997 when he was appointed to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He quickly gained a reputation as a progressive voice on the board, advocating for issues such as same-sex marriage and universal healthcare. In 2003, he was elected mayor of San Francisco, becoming the city's youngest mayor in over a century. As mayor, Newsom implemented a number of progressive policies, including universal healthcare for city residents and a program to provide homeless people with housing and services. He also gained national attention for his decision to allow same-sex marriages to take place in San Francisco, which led to a legal battle that ultimately resulted in the state's legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2010, Newsom was elected lieutenant governor of California, serving under Governor Jerry Brown. During his time as lieutenant governor, he focused on issues such as renewable energy and early childhood education. In 2018, Newsom ran for governor of California and won in a landslide victory. As governor, he has continued to champion progressive policies, including expanding healthcare coverage, increasing funding for education, and addressing the state's housing crisis. He has also been a vocal critic of the Trump administration's immigration policies and has taken steps to protect undocumented immigrants in California. Overall, Gavin Newsom is known for his progressive politics and his commitment to social justice issues. He has been a leading voice in the fight for LGBTQ rights and has worked to make California a more equitable and inclusive state.",

Despite these challenges, Trudeau remains a popular figure in Canadian politics, with a strong base of support among young voters and progressive Canadians.

Born on December 21, 1977, in Amiens, Macron was educated at the Lycée Henri-IV in Paris and later attended the École nationale d'administration (ENA) where he graduated in 2004. After completing his education, Macron worked as an Inspector of Finances in the French Ministry of Economy. In 2012, Macron joined the administration of President François Hollande as Deputy Secretary-General of the Élysée Palace. He later served as Minister of the Economy, Industry, and Digital Affairs from 2014 to 2016. During his tenure as Minister, Macron implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at boosting growth and reducing unemployment in France. In 2016, Macron resigned from his position as Minister and founded his own political party, En Marche! (On the Move!). The party was founded on a centrist platform and aimed to bridge the gap between the left and right in French politics. Macron's decision to run for President in 2017 was met with skepticism from many in the French political establishment, but he was able to win the election in a landslide victory. As President, Macron has continued to pursue his centrist agenda, implementing a series of reforms aimed at modernizing the French economy and reducing bureaucracy. He has also been a vocal advocate for European integration and has called for greater cooperation between European nations on issues such as immigration and defense. Macron's presidency has not been without controversy, however. His proposed reforms to the French labor code have been met with protests from labor unions, and his handling of the Yellow Vest protests in 2018 and 2019 was criticized by some as heavy-handed. Despite these challenges, Macron remains a popular figure in French politics and has been praised for his efforts to modernize the French economy and promote European integration.",

Putin is widely considered to be one of the most powerful and influential politicians in the world, and his leadership has been marked by a strong emphasis on national security, economic development, and the restoration of Russia's status as a major world power. Born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) in 1952, Putin graduated from Leningrad State University in 1975 with a law degree. He joined the KGB, the Soviet Union's security agency, and served as a foreign intelligence officer in East Germany from 1985 to 1990. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Putin entered politics and served as the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB's successor agency, from 1998 to 1999. In 1999, Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin as Prime Minister, and when Yeltsin resigned on December 31 of that year, Putin became acting President. He was elected President in 2000, and during his first two terms in office, he oversaw significant economic growth and stability in Russia. However, his tenure was also marked by a crackdown on political opposition and the media, as well as allegations of human rights abuses and corruption. After serving as Prime Minister under President Dmitry Medvedev from 2008 to 2012, Putin was elected President again in 2012 and re-elected in 2018.

He is also the President of the People's Republic of China and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission. Xi Jinping is considered one of the most powerful leaders in China's history, and his policies have had a significant impact on the country's political, economic, and social landscape. Born in 1953 in Beijing, Xi Jinping is the son of Xi Zhongxun, a prominent Communist Party leader who was purged during the Cultural Revolution. Xi Jinping was sent to the countryside for \"re-education\" during this time, but he later returned to Beijing and joined the Communist Party in 1974. He rose through the ranks of the party, serving in various leadership positions in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. In 2007, Xi Jinping was appointed to the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in China. He was widely seen as the heir apparent to then-President Hu Jintao, and in 2012, he was elected as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. He became the President of the People's Republic of China in 2013, succeeding Hu Jintao. Xi Jinping's leadership has been characterized by a focus on strengthening the Communist Party's control over all aspects of Chinese society. He has launched a massive anti-corruption campaign that has targeted both high-ranking officials and low-level bureaucrats. The campaign has been popular with the Chinese public, but it has also been criticized for being used as a tool to eliminate political rivals. Xi Jinping has also pursued an ambitious foreign policy agenda, seeking to expand China's influence on the global stage. He has launched the Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project that aims to connect China with countries across Asia, Europe, and Africa. He has also taken a more assertive stance on territorial disputes in the South China Sea, leading to tensions with neighboring countries and the United States. Despite his popularity among the Chinese public, Xi Jinping's leadership has been criticized for its authoritarian tendencies. He has cracked down on dissent and tightened controls on the media and the internet. Some observers have also expressed concern about his efforts to consolidate power, including the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Overall, Xi Jinping's leadership has had a profound impact on China's political, economic, and social development.",

He is the third and youngest son of Kim Jong-il and his consort Ko Yong-hui. From late 2010, Kim Jong-un was viewed as heir apparent to the leadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and assumed important posts in the party and army organs. He has been the First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea since 2012, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission since 2016, and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army since 2011. Kim Jong-un was born on 8 January 1982 in Pyongyang, North Korea. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he was educated in Switzerland. He returned to North Korea in 2000 and began working in the National Defense Commission, the country's top military body. In 2009, he was appointed to the powerful Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea. Kim Jong-un became the Supreme Leader of North Korea following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in December 2011. He was officially declared the \"Great Successor\" and \"Supreme Commander\" of the Korean People's Army. Since taking power, Kim Jong-un has pursued a policy of \"byungjin\", which aims to develop the country's economy and nuclear weapons program simultaneously. Under Kim Jong-un's leadership, North Korea has conducted several nuclear tests and missile launches, which have led to increased tensions with the international community. In 2018, Kim Jong-un met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump, marking the first time a North Korean leader had met with a sitting US president. The meetings were seen as a potential breakthrough in the long-standing conflict between North Korea and the international community. Kim Jong-un is known for his reclusive nature and has rarely been seen in public. He is married to Ri Sol-ju and has at least one child. He is also known for his love of basketball and has been reported to have a close relationship with former NBA player Dennis Rodman. Kim Jong-un's leadership has been criticized for its human rights abuses, including the use of forced labor camps and the suppression of political dissent. However, he remains a popular figure in North Korea and is seen as a symbol of the country's strength and independence.",

Bolsonaro began his political career in 1988 when he was elected as a city councilor in Rio de Janeiro. He later served as a federal deputy for the state of Rio de Janeiro from 1991 to 2018. During his time in Congress, Bolsonaro gained a reputation for his outspoken and often controversial statements, particularly on issues related to race, gender, and sexuality. Bolsonaro's political ideology is often described as far-right, and he has been criticized for his support of authoritarianism and his opposition to democracy. He has expressed admiration for past military regimes in Brazil and has been accused of promoting violence and discrimination against marginalized groups. Despite his controversial views, Bolsonaro was elected as President of Brazil in 2018, defeating his left-wing opponent Fernando Haddad in a run-off election. His campaign focused on promises to combat corruption, reduce crime, and revive the Brazilian economy. Since taking office, Bolsonaro has implemented a number of controversial policies, including loosening gun control laws, cutting funding for social programs, and rolling back environmental protections in the Amazon rainforest. He has also faced criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, which has been one of the worst-hit countries in the world.

            "passage": "Boris Johnson is a British politician, journalist, and former Mayor of London. He was born in New York City in 1964 to British parents and was educated at Eton College and the University of Oxford. After graduating, he worked as a journalist for various newspapers, including The Times and The Daily Telegraph, where he became known for his controversial and often humorous writing style. In 2001, Johnson was elected to Parliament as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Henley-on-Thames. He quickly gained a reputation as a maverick politician, known for his outspoken views on a range of issues, including the European Union, immigration, and the environment. In 2008, he was elected Mayor of London, defeating the incumbent, Ken Livingstone. As Mayor, Johnson oversaw a number of major projects, including the construction of the Olympic Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics and the introduction of the Boris Bike scheme, which provided a network of public bicycles for hire across the city. He also championed the Crossrail project, a major new railway line that will run through London and the southeast of England. In 2016, Johnson became a leading figure in the campaign for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, known as Brexit. He was a prominent member of the Vote Leave campaign and was widely seen as one of the key figures in securing the victory for the Leave side in the referendum. Following the referendum, Johnson was appointed as Foreign Secretary by Prime Minister Theresa May. However, he resigned from the position in 2018, citing his disagreement with May's Brexit strategy. In July 2019, he was elected leader of the Conservative Party and became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, succeeding Theresa May. As Prime Minister, Johnson has faced a number of challenges, including the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the COVID-19 pandemic. He has been criticized for his handling of the pandemic, particularly in the early stages, and for his controversial decision to prorogue Parliament in 2019. However, he remains a popular figure among many Conservative Party supporters and is known for his charismatic and often humorous style of leadership.",

He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Modi was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, a small town in the state of Gujarat, India. Modi started his political career as a member of the RSS, a right-wing Hindu nationalist organization. He later joined the BJP and rose through the ranks to become the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001. He served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat for three consecutive terms, from 2001 to 2014. Modi is known for his economic policies, which have focused on promoting entrepreneurship, attracting foreign investment, and creating jobs. He has also been a strong advocate for digital India, promoting the use of technology to improve governance and increase transparency. Modi's foreign policy has been marked by a focus on improving India's relations with its neighbors and expanding its global influence. He has made several high-profile visits to countries such as the United States, China, and Japan, and has been instrumental in strengthening India's ties with these countries. Modi has also been a controversial figure, with critics accusing him of promoting a Hindu nationalist agenda and being intolerant of religious minorities. His government has been accused of cracking down on dissent and limiting freedom of speech. Despite these controversies, Modi remains a popular figure in India, with many people seeing him as a strong and decisive leader who is committed to improving the country's economy and global standing. His government has launched several ambitious initiatives, such as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) and the Make in India campaign, which aim to improve the country's infrastructure and promote manufacturing and entrepreneurship. Overall, Narendra Modi is a complex and polarizing figure in Indian politics, with a legacy that is likely to be debated for years to come.",

Netanyahu is the leader of the Likud party and is known for his conservative views and strong stance on security issues. Born in Tel Aviv in 1949, Netanyahu grew up in Jerusalem and attended high school in the United States. He served in the Israeli military as a soldier and officer in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit. After leaving the military, Netanyahu studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, where he earned degrees in architecture and business. Netanyahu began his political career in the 1980s, serving as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations and later as a member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1988 and later served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2002 to 2003. Netanyahu's first term as Prime Minister began in 1996, when he defeated incumbent Shimon Peres in a close election. During his first term, Netanyahu implemented economic reforms and pursued a hardline approach to security issues, including the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. After losing the 1999 election to Ehud Barak, Netanyahu briefly retired from politics and worked in the private sector. He returned to politics in 2002 and was elected leader of the Likud party in 2005. In 2009, Netanyahu was once again elected Prime Minister, this time in a coalition government with the centrist Kadima party. During his second term, Netanyahu has focused on security issues, including the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program. He has also pursued peace negotiations with the Palestinians, although these efforts have been largely unsuccessful. Netanyahu's leadership style has been described as strong and decisive, but also divisive and polarizing. He has been criticized for his handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for his close relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump. Despite these criticisms, Netanyahu remains a popular and influential figure in Israeli politics. He has been re-elected several times and is widely regarded as one of Israel's most important and influential leaders.",

He previously served as the Prime Minister of Turkey from 2003 to 2014. Erdogan is the founder of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), which has been in power since 2002. Erdogan was born in Istanbul in 1954 and grew up in a working-class family. He attended Marmara University in Istanbul, where he studied economics and business administration. After graduating, he worked as a semi-professional football player and later as a manager in a local government office. Erdogan's political career began in the 1970s when he became involved in Islamist politics. He was a member of several Islamist parties before founding the AKP in 2001. The AKP won a landslide victory in the 2002 general election, and Erdogan became the Prime Minister of Turkey. During his time as Prime Minister, Erdogan implemented a number of reforms aimed at modernizing Turkey and improving its economy. He also pursued a policy of rapprochement with the European Union, although Turkey's accession negotiations have stalled in recent years. Erdogan's tenure as Prime Minister was not without controversy. He was accused of authoritarianism and of suppressing dissent, particularly after a series of protests in 2013. He also faced criticism for his handling of the conflict in Syria and for his government's crackdown on the Kurdish minority in Turkey. In 2014, Erdogan was elected as the President of Turkey in the country's first direct presidential election. He has since consolidated his power, with the AKP winning a majority in the 2015 general election and a constitutional referendum in 2017 granting him sweeping new powers. Erdogan's presidency has been marked by a number of challenges, including a failed coup attempt in 2016 and a deteriorating relationship with the United States and other Western countries. He has also faced criticism for his government's crackdown on the media and civil society, as well as for its handling of the Syrian refugee crisis. Despite these challenges, Erdogan remains a popular figure in Turkey, particularly among conservative and nationalist voters. He has been praised for his efforts to improve the country's infrastructure and for his strong leadership in the face of external threats. However, his critics argue that his authoritarian tendencies and his government's human rights record pose a threat to Turkey's democracy and its place in the international community.",

He was born on August 31, 1985, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and is the son of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. Mohammed bin Salman is known for his ambitious plans to modernize Saudi Arabia and diversify its economy away from oil. Mohammed bin Salman began his political career in 2009 when he was appointed as a special advisor to his father, who was then the Governor of Riyadh. In 2015, he was appointed as the Minister of Defense, making him the youngest defense minister in the world at the age of 30. As defense minister, Mohammed bin Salman led Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen, which has been criticized for causing a humanitarian crisis in the country. In 2017, Mohammed bin Salman was appointed as Crown Prince, replacing his cousin Mohammed bin Nayef. He has since launched a series of ambitious economic and social reforms under the banner of Vision 2030. These reforms include plans to privatize state-owned companies, attract foreign investment, and increase the participation of women in the workforce. Mohammed bin Salman has also been involved in a number of controversial incidents. In 2017, he ordered the arrest of dozens of Saudi businessmen and officials in what he called an anti-corruption crackdown. Critics accused him of using the crackdown to consolidate his power and eliminate potential rivals. In 2018, Mohammed bin Salman was implicated in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The CIA concluded that Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the killing, but the Saudi government denied any involvement. The incident sparked international outrage and strained Saudi Arabia's relations with the United States and other Western countries. Despite these controversies, Mohammed bin Salman remains a powerful figure in Saudi Arabia and a key player in the Middle East. His ambitious plans for economic and social reform have the potential to transform the country, but they also face significant challenges and opposition from conservative elements within Saudi society.",

The district includes the eastern part of the Bronx and portions of north-central Queens in New York City.

Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican mother and a father of Puerto Rican and Bronxite descent. She graduated from Boston University in 2011 with a degree in economics and international relations. After college, she worked as an educational director for the National Hispanic Institute and as a bartender and waitress in New York City. In 2016, she worked as an organizer for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. In June 2018, Ocasio-Cortez won the Democratic primary for New York's 14th congressional district, defeating incumbent Joe Crowley, who had held the seat for 10 terms.

He was the Republican Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 election, but ultimately lost to incumbent President Barack Obama. Romney was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1947 and raised in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. He attended Brigham Young University and Harvard University, where he earned degrees in business and law. After graduating from Harvard, Romney worked for the management consulting firm Bain & Company before co-founding the private equity firm Bain Capital in 1984. He became wealthy through his work in the private sector and was involved in the management of several successful companies, including Staples, Inc. and Domino's Pizza. Romney first entered politics in 1994, when he challenged incumbent Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy for his seat in the U.S. Senate. Although he lost the election, Romney gained national recognition and became a prominent figure in the Republican Party. He was elected Governor of Massachusetts in 2002, defeating Democratic nominee Shannon O'Brien. As Governor, Romney implemented several policies aimed at improving the state's economy and education system. He also signed into law a healthcare reform bill that required all Massachusetts residents to have health insurance. The law became a model for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which was signed into law by President Obama in 2010. In 2008, Romney ran for the Republican Party's nomination for President of the United States, but lost to Senator John McCain. He ran again in 2012 and won the nomination, but ultimately lost the general election to President Obama. During his campaign, Romney faced criticism for his wealth and his perceived lack of empathy for working-class Americans. After his unsuccessful presidential bid, Romney returned to the private sector and became involved in various philanthropic and political endeavors. He was elected to the U.S. Senate from Utah in 2018, succeeding retiring Senator Orrin Hatch. As a Senator, Romney has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump and has occasionally broken with his party on certain issues. Overall, Mitt Romney is a prominent figure in American politics and business, known for his wealth, his conservative views, and his occasional willingness to break with his party.",

He is the co-founder, CEO, and majority owner of Bloomberg L.P., a global financial services, software, and media company headquartered in New York City. He served as the 108th Mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013. Bloomberg was born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised in a middle-class Jewish family in Medford, Massachusetts. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. He then attended Harvard Business School, receiving a Master of Business Administration degree in 1966. After graduating from Harvard, Bloomberg worked at Salomon Brothers, a Wall Street investment bank, for 15 years. In 1981, he was fired from Salomon Brothers and used his severance package to start his own company, Innovative Market Systems, which later became Bloomberg L.P. The company provides financial software tools and data services to financial professionals around the world. Bloomberg was elected Mayor of New York City in 2001, succeeding Rudy Giuliani. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009, serving a total of three terms. As Mayor, Bloomberg implemented a number of controversial policies, including a ban on smoking in public places, a ban on trans fats in restaurants, and a requirement that chain restaurants post calorie counts on their menus. He also launched a number of initiatives aimed at improving public health, reducing crime, and promoting economic development. After leaving office in 2013, Bloomberg returned to Bloomberg L.P. as CEO. He has also been active in philanthropy, donating billions of dollars to various causes through his Bloomberg Philanthropies foundation. In 2020, Bloomberg ran for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, but dropped out of the race after a poor showing in the Super Tuesday primaries. Bloomberg is known for his moderate political views and his support for gun control, climate action, and immigration reform. He has been criticized for his support of stop-and-frisk policing, which disproportionately targeted people of color, and for his close ties to Wall Street. Despite these criticisms, Bloomberg remains one of the wealthiest and most influential people in the world, with a net worth of over $50 billion.",

He was born on January 13, 1975, in Schenectady, New York, to immigrant parents from Taiwan. Yang attended Brown University, where he earned a degree in economics and political science. He later attended Columbia Law School, but ultimately decided not to pursue a career in law. After working in various startups and technology companies, Yang founded Venture for America (VFA) in 2011. VFA is a nonprofit organization that trains and places recent college graduates in startups in cities across the United States. Yang served as CEO of VFA until 2017, when he stepped down to run for president. Yang announced his candidacy for president in November 2017, running as a Democrat. His campaign focused on the idea of a universal basic income (UBI), which he called the Freedom Dividend. Under Yang's plan, every American adult would receive $1,000 per month, regardless of their income or employment status. Yang argued that UBI was necessary to address the economic challenges posed by automation and artificial intelligence. Despite being a relatively unknown candidate at the start of the race, Yang gained a significant following online and in person. He qualified for all of the Democratic debates and outlasted several more established politicians. However, he ultimately suspended his campaign in February 2020 after a disappointing showing in the New Hampshire primary. Since ending his presidential campaign, Yang has remained active in politics and public life. He launched a nonprofit organization called Humanity Forward, which advocates for UBI and other policies to address economic inequality. He also became a commentator on CNN and a frequent guest on podcasts and talk shows. In 2021, Yang announced his candidacy for mayor of New York City. His campaign focused on issues such as affordable housing, small business support, and public safety. However, he ultimately finished in fourth place in the Democratic primary, behind Eric Adams, Maya Wiley, and Kathryn Garcia. Throughout his career, Yang has been known for his unconventional ideas and approach to politics. He has been praised for his ability to connect with young and disaffected voters, as well as his willingness to challenge the status quo. However, he has also faced criticism for his lack of political experience and some of his more controversial proposals, such as the use of \"smart cameras\" to monitor crime in New York City.",

It is a part of the Chicago metropolitan area, bordering two northwestern neighborhoods of Chicago's Far North Side (Edison Park and Norwood Park). As its name suggests, Park Ridge lies on a ridge. The soil is abundant with clay deposits, which made it a brick-making center for the developing city of Chicago. Park Ridge was originally called Pennyville to honor George Penny, the businessman who owned the local brickyard along with Robert Meacham. Later it was named Brickton. The Des Plaines River divides Park Ridge from neighboring Des Plaines, Illinois, which is west of Park Ridge. Park Ridge is a prime residential community, with a vibrant downtown area that includes the Pickwick Theatre, a classic movie palace that is now a venue for live music and stage shows. The city is also home to the Park Ridge Country Club, which has hosted the Western Open and the U.S. Senior Open golf championships.

He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977, then as the \"Brotherly Leader\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism but later came to rule under his own Third International Theory. Gaddafi was born near Sirte to an impoverished Bedouin family. He became an Arab nationalist while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary cell which, in a 1969 coup, overthrew the Western-backed monarchy of Idris I. Gaddafi was initially hailed as a hero by some in Libya and elsewhere for his role in ousting the monarchy, but he quickly became known for his eccentric and often brutal style of governance. He established a political philosophy known as the Third International Theory, which he described as a hybrid of socialism and Islam. He was also known for his support of various revolutionary movements and his opposition to Israel. Gaddafi's rule was characterized by authoritarianism, political repression, and human rights abuses. He was accused of ordering the Lockerbie bombing in 1988, which killed 270 people, and of supporting various terrorist groups. In 2011, a popular uprising against Gaddafi's rule broke out, which was supported by NATO forces. Gaddafi was captured and killed by rebel forces in October of that year.

The Democratic-Republican Party was characterized by its support for states' rights, limited government, and a strict interpretation of the Constitution. In the early 19th century, the Democratic-Republican Party split into two factions: the National Republicans, who supported a strong federal government and a broad interpretation of the Constitution, and the Democratic Party, which continued to advocate for states' rights and limited government. The Democratic Party became the dominant political force in the United States during the presidency of Andrew Jackson, who was elected in 1828. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Democratic Party was associated with a number of progressive causes, including the abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, and workers' rights. The party also supported a number of social welfare programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, which were enacted during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In recent years, the Democratic Party has become increasingly associated with progressive causes such as environmentalism, LGBTQ rights, and income inequality. The party has also become more diverse, with a growing number of women, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ community running for and winning elected office under the Democratic banner.

It also has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal court and state court cases that involve a point of federal constitutional or statutory law. The Court has the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution or an executive act for being unlawful. However, it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction. The Court may decide cases having political overtones, but it has ruled that it does not have power to decide nonjusticiable political questions. Each year it agrees to hear about 100-150 of the more than 7,000 cases that it is asked to review. Typically, the Court hears cases that have been decided in either an appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals or the highest court in a given state (if the state court decided a Constitutional issue). The Court may also accept cases through the certiorari process, by which four justices agree to hear a particular case. The Court meets in the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C.

He is known for his opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage, as well as his support for limited government, free markets, and traditional values. During his time as Vice President, Pence was a key figure in the Trump administration's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, cut taxes, and strengthen border security. He also played a prominent role in the administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading the White House Coronavirus Task Force and working to coordinate the federal government's response to the crisis. Pence's tenure as Vice President was not without controversy, however. He faced criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly his reluctance to wear a mask and his support for reopening the economy despite rising case numbers. He also faced criticism for his role in the Trump administration's controversial immigration policies, including the separation of families at the border.

Vermont is the second-smallest by population and the sixth-smallest by area of the 50 U.S. states. The state capital is Montpelier, the least populous state capital in the United States. The most populous city, Burlington, is the least populous city to be the most populous city in a state. As of 2019, Vermont was the leading producer of maple syrup in the United States. It was ranked as the safest state in the country in 2016. For thousands of years, indigenous peoples, including the Mohawk and the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki, occupied much of the territory that is now Vermont and was later claimed by France's colony of New France. France ceded the territory to Great Britain after being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years' War. For many years, the nearby colonies, especially the provinces of New Hampshire and New York, disputed control of the area (then called the New Hampshire Grants). Settlers who held land titles granted by these colonies were opposed by the Green Mountain Boys militia, which eventually prevailed in creating an independent state, the Vermont Republic, founded during the Revolutionary War and lasting for 14 years. In 1791, Vermont joined the United States as the 14th state. The state is known for its natural landscape, which includes the Green Mountains, Lake Champlain, and the Connecticut River. It is also known for its dairy products, maple syrup, and artisanal cheeses. The state capital, Montpelier, is the smallest state capital in the United States.

He was born on June 5, 1939, in High River, Alberta, and grew up in the nearby town of Rocky Mountain House. Clark was educated at the University of Alberta, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1960 and a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1963. He was called to the bar in Alberta in 1963 and practiced law in Edmonton until he entered politics in 1972. Clark was first elected to the House of Commons in 1972 as the Member of Parliament for Rocky Mountain. He quickly rose through the ranks of the Progressive Conservative Party and was elected leader in 1976. In the 1979 federal election, Clark led the Progressive Conservatives to victory, defeating the incumbent Liberal government led by Pierre Trudeau. At the age of 39, he became the youngest person ever to be elected Prime Minister of Canada. Clark's tenure as Prime Minister was short-lived, however. His government was defeated in a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons in 1980, and he was forced to call a new election. In the subsequent election, the Progressive Conservatives were defeated by the Liberals, and Clark resigned as party leader. Despite his brief time in office, Clark is remembered as a principled and effective leader who brought a new sense of energy and optimism to Canadian politics. He was known for his commitment to fiscal responsibility, his support for free trade, and his efforts to promote national unity. After leaving politics, Clark continued to be active in public life, serving as a diplomat and as a member of various boards and commissions.

Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by area. The country is officially divided into 23 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. China emerged as one of the world's earliest civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-legendary Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty, which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa. The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. In the late 19th century, the Qing dynasty was overthrown following the Boxer Rebellion, which was itself crushed by an international alliance led by the Eight-Nation Alliance. The establishment of the Republic of China in 1912 led to the Chinese Civil War and the division of China into the two political entities of the PRC and the ROC. The PRC is a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of China, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. The PRC also claims Taiwan – which is controlled by the ROC – as its 23rd province, a claim controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan and the unresolved Chinese Civil War.",

Xi Jinping is considered to be one of the most powerful leaders in China's history, and his policies have had a significant impact on the country's political, economic, and social landscape. Born in 1953 in Beijing, Xi Jinping is the son of Xi Zhongxun, a prominent Communist Party leader who was purged during the Cultural Revolution. Xi Jinping spent his early years in rural Shaanxi province, where he worked as a farmer and later as a local official. He joined the Communist Party in 1974 and rose through the ranks of the party and government bureaucracy over the next few decades. Xi Jinping's leadership style is often described as authoritarian, and he has been criticized for cracking down on dissent and tightening control over the media and civil society. However, he has also launched a number of ambitious reform initiatives, including an anti-corruption campaign that has targeted high-level officials and businesspeople. Under Xi Jinping's leadership, China has become more assertive on the global stage, with a more aggressive foreign policy and a focus on expanding its influence in Asia and beyond. Xi Jinping has also championed the Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project that aims to connect China with Europe, Africa, and other parts of Asia. Despite his many accomplishments, Xi Jinping faces a number of challenges, including a slowing economy, rising social unrest, and growing tensions with the United States and other countries.

It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The population of Australia is approximately 26 million people, making it the world's 52nd most populous country. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century, who named it New Holland. In 1770, James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for Great Britain, and the British established a penal colony in New South Wales in 1788. The population grew steadily in the following years, and by the 1850s, Australia was experiencing a gold rush, which led to the establishment of several new cities. Australia is a highly developed country with a strong economy and a high standard of living. It is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific Islands Forum. Australia is also known for its unique flora and fauna, including kangaroos, koalas, and the Great Barrier Reef. Australia is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government. The Queen of Australia, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is also the monarch of 15 other Commonwealth realms. The Australian government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The Prime Minister is the head of government, and the Governor-General is the representative of the monarch. Australia has a diverse and multicultural society, with a significant Indigenous population and immigrants from all over the world. English is the official language, and Christianity is the most widely practiced religion. However, Australia is also known for its secularism and commitment to religious freedom.",

Established in 1636 and named for its first benefactor, clergyman John Harvard, Harvard is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and among the most prestigious in the world. The Massachusetts colonial legislature, the General Court, authorized Harvard's founding. In its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy, although it has never been formally affiliated with any denomination. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II; he liberalized admissions after the war. The university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Arts and Sciences, which includes Harvard College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, is the largest of the ten faculties and is the only division to offer undergraduate education. Harvard also has five additional academic divisions: Harvard Business School, Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Medical School. Harvard's endowment is valued at $41.9 billion, making it the largest of any academic institution. Endowment income helps enable the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide generous financial aid with no loans The Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.",

He studied economics at Marmara University and became involved in politics in the 1970s. He was elected mayor of Istanbul in 1994 and served in that position until 1998. He was later imprisoned for four months for reciting a poem that was deemed to be inflammatory. After his release from prison, Erdogan founded the AKP and led the party to victory in the 2002 general election. He became Prime Minister and implemented a series of economic and political reforms that helped to modernize Turkey and improve its standing in the international community. However, his government has also been criticized for its crackdown on dissent and its restrictions on freedom of speech and the press. Erdogan has been a controversial figure both in Turkey and abroad. He has been accused of authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights abuses.

The app allows users to upload photos and videos to the service, which can be edited with various filters, and organized with tags and location information. An account's posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, and view trending content. Users can \"like\" photos, and follow other users to add their content to a feed. The service was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) aspect ratio with 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone 4, 4s, 5, 5s and SE. In 2015, these restrictions were eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, as well as \"Stories\"—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each.

At its foundation, Brown was the first college in the United States to accept students regardless of their religious affiliation. Its engineering program, established in 1847, was the first in what is now known as the Ivy League. Brown's New Curriculum—sometimes referred to in education theory as the Brown Curriculum—was adopted by faculty vote in 1969 after a period of student lobbying; the New Curriculum eliminated mandatory \"general education\" distribution requirements, made students \"the architects of their own syllabus,\" and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory or unrecorded no-credit. In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution, Pembroke College, was fully merged into the university. Undergraduate admissions is highly selective, with an acceptance rate of 6.9% for the class of 2024.
