The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia. The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games. The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet. The 2010 World Cup in South Africa was broadcast to 204 countries on 245 different channels. The World Cup is held in a different country every four years. The host country is chosen by FIFA's Council, which is composed of representatives from each of the six regional confederations, and the decision is usually made six years before the tournament is scheduled to take place. The tournament consists of two stages: the group stage and the knockout stage. In the group stage, the 32 teams are divided into eight groups of four teams each, where each team plays the other three teams in its group once. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage, which consists of a single-elimination tournament culminating in the final match. The World Cup has a rich history, with many memorable moments and legendary players. Some of the most famous moments in World Cup history include Diego Maradona's \"Hand of God\" goal in the 1986 quarterfinals, Zinedine Zidane's headbutt in the 2006 final, and the \"Miracle of Bern\" in 1954, when West Germany defeated Hungary in the final after being down 2-0 at halftime. Some of the most famous players in World Cup history include Pelé, Maradona, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi. The World Cup has also had a significant impact on the countries that have hosted it.",

The tournament was first contested in 2000 as the FIFA Club World Championship. It was not held between 2001 and 2004 due to a combination of factors, most importantly the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure. Since 2005, the competition has been held every year, and has been hosted by Brazil, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Qatar, and China. The tournament is contested by the champion clubs from the six continental confederations of FIFA, as well as the host nation's league champions. The current format of the competition involves seven teams competing in a knockout tournament, with the winner being crowned the FIFA Club World Cup champion. The most successful club in the history of the competition is Real Madrid, who have won the tournament four times. Other notable winners include Barcelona, Corinthians, and Bayern Munich, who have each won the tournament twice. The FIFA Club World Cup has been criticized for its lack of prestige and relevance, with many top European clubs choosing to prioritize domestic and continental competitions over the tournament. However, FIFA has made efforts to increase the profile of the competition, including expanding the number of teams and increasing the prize money. Despite these efforts, the FIFA Club World Cup remains a relatively minor competition in the global football calendar. However, it remains an important opportunity for clubs from smaller confederations to compete against the world's best teams, and for fans to see some of the sport's biggest stars in action.",

First staged in 1903, the race covers more than 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi) throughout France and has become one of the most prestigious and grueling events in the sport of cycling. The race is broken into daily stages, with each stage covering a different distance and terrain, and the overall winner being determined by the cumulative time taken to complete all stages. The Tour de France is typically held in July and attracts the world's top cyclists, who compete for the coveted yellow jersey, awarded to the overall race leader. The race is organized by the Amaury Sport Organisation, which also manages other major cycling events such as Paris-Roubaix and the Vuelta a España. The Tour de France has a rich history, with many legendary cyclists having won the race multiple times. The most successful rider in the history of the race is Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx, who won the Tour de France five times between 1969 and 1974. Other notable winners include French riders Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault, American cyclist Lance Armstrong, and British rider Chris Froome. The race is known for its grueling mountain stages, which often feature steep climbs and treacherous descents. These stages are often the most decisive in determining the overall winner of the race, as they require a combination of strength, endurance, and tactical skill. In addition to the yellow jersey, other jerseys are awarded to riders who excel in specific areas of the race. The green jersey is awarded to the rider who accumulates the most points in the sprint stages, while the polka dot jersey is awarded to the best climber in the mountain stages. The white jersey is awarded to the best young rider under the age of 25. The Tour de France has faced controversy in recent years, with several high-profile doping scandals tarnishing the reputation of the race. However, the organizers have taken steps to combat doping, including implementing stricter drug testing protocols and increasing penalties for riders who are caught using performance-enhancing drugs. Despite these challenges, the Tour de France remains one of the most popular and prestigious events in the world of cycling, attracting millions of spectators and television viewers each year. With its rich history, challenging terrain, and fierce competition, the Tour de France is truly a test of the world's best cyclists.",

The competition is contested every two years with the venue alternating between courses in the United States and Europe. The Ryder Cup is named after the English businessman Samuel Ryder who donated the trophy. The event is jointly administered by the PGA of America and Ryder Cup Europe, the latter a joint venture of the PGA European Tour (60%), the PGA of Great Britain and Ireland (20%), and the PGA of Europe (20%). The competition began in 1927, and except for a period during World War II, has been held every two years since. The Ryder Cup is one of the world's most prestigious golf events and is considered by many to be the most prestigious team event in golf. The competition is known for its intense atmosphere and passionate crowds, with players often describing it as the most pressure-packed event they play in. The format of the Ryder Cup has evolved over the years, but the current format consists of 28 matches played over three days. On the first two days, there are four four-ball matches and four foursome matches, with each match worth one point. On the final day, there are 12 singles matches, with each match worth one point. The team with the most points at the end of the competition wins the Ryder Cup. The United States dominated the early years of the competition, winning 18 of the first 23 events. However, since the 1980s, Europe has been the dominant force, winning 11 of the last 16 events. The most recent competition, held in 2018 at Le Golf National in France, was won by Europe by a score of 17.5 to 10.5. The Ryder Cup has produced some of the most memorable moments in golf history, including the \"Miracle at Medinah\" in 2012, when Europe came back from a 10-6 deficit on the final day to win the competition. The Ryder Cup has also been the site of some of the most intense rivalries in golf, including the legendary battles between Seve Ballesteros and Tom Watson in the 1980s. The Ryder Cup is not only a showcase for some of the world's best golfers, but it is also a celebration of the sport's rich history and traditions. The competition is steeped in tradition, from the opening ceremony to the closing ceremony, and is a testament to the enduring appeal of golf as a sport.",

The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia. The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games. The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet. The 2010 World Cup in South Africa was broadcast to 204 countries on 245 different channels. The World Cup is held in a different country every four years. The host country is chosen by FIFA's Council, which is composed of representatives from each of the six regional confederations. The selection process for the host country is highly competitive, with many countries vying for the opportunity to host the tournament. The host country is responsible for providing the infrastructure necessary to host the tournament, including stadiums, transportation, and accommodations for the teams and fans. The tournament consists of 32 teams, which are divided into eight groups of four teams each.

It is scheduled for the first full week of April and is the first of the majors to be played each year. Unlike the other major championships, the Masters is held annually at the same location, Augusta National Golf Club, a private golf club in the city of Augusta, Georgia, USA. The Masters was established in 1934 by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts. Jones designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. The tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club. The tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. The Masters has the smallest field of the major championships, with 90-100 players. Unlike other major championships, players who are not already qualified for the Masters must earn a place by one of several ways. The first is by winning one of the other major championships (the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, or the PGA Championship) or The Players Championship. The second is by winning one of the PGA Tour's other tournaments in the previous year. The third is by finishing in the top 50 on the Official World Golf Ranking at the end of the previous calendar year. Finally, the Augusta National Golf Club can invite international players who do not meet any of the other criteria.

It is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments, along with the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. The tournament is named after the French aviator Roland Garros, who was the first person to fly across the Mediterranean Sea. The French Open is played on clay courts, which are slower and more difficult to play on than other surfaces. This makes the tournament a unique challenge for players, as they must adjust their game to the slower pace of the clay. The tournament is held over two weeks in late May and early June, and features both men's and women's singles, doubles, and mixed doubles events. The French Open has a rich history, dating back to 1891 when it was first held. The tournament has been held at its current location, the Stade Roland Garros, since 1928. The stadium has undergone several renovations over the years, and now features 20 courts, including the main Philippe Chatrier Court, which has a seating capacity of over 15,000. The French Open has been won by some of the greatest players in tennis history, including Rafael Nadal, who has won the tournament a record 13 times. Other notable winners include Bjorn Borg, Chris Evert, Steffi Graf, and Roger Federer. The tournament has also been the site of some of the most memorable matches in tennis history, including the 1984 final between John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl, and the 1999 final between Andre Agassi and Andrei Medvedev. In addition to the tennis, the French Open is also known for its fashion and style. The tournament is a showcase for the latest trends in tennis apparel, and many players and fans alike dress up for the occasion. The tournament also features a variety of food and drink options, including traditional French cuisine and champagne. Overall, the French Open is one of the most prestigious and exciting events in the world of tennis. Its unique clay courts, rich history, and glamorous atmosphere make it a must-see for tennis fans and sports enthusiasts alike.",

It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise, and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) considers it to be one of the most important championships in the sport of ice hockey. The trophy was donated by Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canada, in 1892. Originally, it was awarded to the top amateur hockey team in Canada, but in 1915, it was given exclusively to the NHL. Since then, the Cup has been awarded every year to the NHL playoff champion, with the exception of 2005, when the season was cancelled due to a labor dispute. The Stanley Cup is made of silver and nickel alloy, and stands 35.25 inches tall and weighs 34.5 pounds. The Cup is made up of three parts: the bowl, the bands, and the collar. The bowl is the main part of the trophy, and is where the names of the winning teams are engraved. The bands are added to the bowl as more names are added, and the collar is the top part of the trophy, which features the NHL logo and the names of the trustees who oversee the Cup. The Cup is unique in that it is not owned by any one team, but rather by the NHL. The winning team is allowed to keep the Cup for a year, and each player on the winning team gets to spend a day with the Cup, taking it wherever they want and doing whatever they want with it. This tradition has led to some interesting and unusual stories over the years, such as players taking the Cup to their hometowns, on fishing trips, and even to the top of mountains. The Stanley Cup playoffs are a grueling and intense competition, with 16 teams competing in a best-of-seven series to determine the champion. The playoffs are divided into four rounds: the first round, the conference semifinals, the conference finals, and the Stanley Cup Finals. The team that wins the Finals is awarded the Cup, and the players and coaches are given championship rings to commemorate their victory. The Stanley Cup has become an iconic symbol of hockey, and is revered by players and fans alike. Its rich history and tradition make it one of the most coveted trophies in all of sports, and winning it is the ultimate goal for any NHL team.",

Since around 1850, Europe is most commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Although the term \"continent\" implies physical geography, the land border is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East-West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The border does not follow political boundaries, with Turkey, Russia, and Kazakhstan being transcontinental countries. Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which the Russian Federation is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population.

The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center, an arena shared with the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association, and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League. The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA, and have won 17 NBA championships, tied with the Boston Celtics for the most in NBA history. The franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team, the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL). The new team began playing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, calling themselves the Minneapolis Lakers. Initially a member of the NBL, the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they would win five of the next six championships, led by star George Mikan. After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan's retirement, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. Led by Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West, Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost each series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1972, the Lakers won their sixth championship, led by Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, and Gail Goodrich, who were known for their fast break offense. The team featured Hall of Famers in Chamberlain, West, and coach Pat Riley, and a Hall of Fame broadcaster in Chick Hearn. After the retirement of West and Chamberlain, the team acquired another center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won multiple MVP awards, but was unable to make the Finals in the late 1970s. The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to their fast break-offense led by Magic Johnson. The team won five championships in a nine-year span, and contained Hall of Famers Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar, and James Worthy, and was led by Hall of Fame coach Pat Riley. After Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson retired, the team struggled in the early 1990s, before acquiring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996.",

The population grew steadily in the following years, and by the 1850s, Australia was experiencing a gold rush, which led to the establishment of several new cities. Australia is a highly developed country with a strong economy and a high standard of living. It is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific Islands Forum.

The Queen of Australia, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is also the monarch of 15 other Commonwealth realms. The Australian government is divided into three branches: the executive branch, headed by the Prime Minister; the legislative branch, consisting of the bicameral Parliament; and the judicial branch, headed by the High Court of Australia.
