The EP featured collaborations with artists such as Cardi B and Travis Barker. Lil Nas X's music has been described as a fusion of various genres, including hip-hop, country, and pop. In addition to his music, Lil Nas X has been praised for his openness about his sexuality. In June 2019, he came out as gay on Twitter, becoming one of the few openly gay rappers in the mainstream music industry. He has since been an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and has used his platform to raise awareness about issues affecting the community. Lil Nas X has also been recognized for his fashion sense and has been featured in campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein and Christian Cowan. He has been known to wear bold and colorful outfits, often incorporating elements of cowboy and western wear into his looks.

The county is low-lying with very few hills, and is largely arable land with the wetlands of the Broads in the north. The Suffolk Coast and Heaths are an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. By the fifth century, the Angles (after whom East Anglia and England are named) had established control of the region. The Angles later became the \"East Saxons\", from which \"Essex\" and \"Middlesex\" derive. Suffolk and several adjacent areas became the kingdom of East Anglia, which later merged with Mercia and then Wessex. Suffolk was originally divided into four separate Quarter Sessions divisions. In 1860, the number of divisions was reduced to two. The eastern division was administered from Ipswich and the western from Bury St Edmunds. Under the Local Government Act 1888, the two divisions were made the separate administrative counties of East Suffolk and West Suffolk; Ipswich became a county borough. A few Essex parishes were also added to Suffolk: Ballingdon-with-Brundon and parts of Haverhill and Kedington. On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, East Suffolk, West Suffolk, and Ipswich were merged to form the unified county of Suffolk.",

She is known for her unconventionality, provocative work, and visual experimentation. She began performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21, through New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, before dropping out to pursue a career in music. When Def Jam Recordings canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where Akon helped her sign a joint deal with Interscope Records and his own label KonLive Distribution in 2007. Gaga rose to prominence the following year with her debut studio album, The Fame, and its chart-topping singles \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\". The album was later reissued to include the EP The Fame Monster (2009), which yielded the successful singles \"Bad Romance\", \"Telephone\", and \"Alejandro\". Gaga's second full-length album, Born This Way (2011), explored electronic rock and techno-pop and debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with more than one million copies sold in its first week. Its title track became the fastest-selling song on the iTunes Store with over a million downloads in less than a week. Gaga experimented with EDM on her third studio album, Artpop (2013), which reached number one in the US and included the single \"Applause\". Her collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett, Cheek to Cheek (2014), and her soft rock-influenced fifth studio album, Joanne (2016), also topped the US charts. During this period, Gaga ventured into acting, playing leading roles in the miniseries American Horror Story: Hotel (2015–2016), for which she received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and the critically acclaimed musical drama A Star Is Born (2018), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Gaga has sold 124 million records as of 2021, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.

It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering, while the red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars. The red color of blood comes from protein hemoglobin, while ripe strawberries, red apples and reddish autumn leaves are colored by anthocyanins. Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces. In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. Red became the color of revolution; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries. Today, red is commonly associated with love, passion, anger, and warning signs.",

The app allows users to upload photos and videos to the service, which can be edited with various filters, and organized with tags and location information. An account's posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, and view trending content. Users can \"like\" photos, and follow other users to add their content to a feed. The service was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) aspect ratio with 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone 4, 4s, 5, 5s and SE. In 2015, these restrictions were eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, as well as \"Stories\"—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each.

He played as a defender for several clubs in Ireland and England, including Belfast Celtic, Sheffield Wednesday, Hull City, Manchester United, and Dumbarton. O'Connell also earned 20 caps for the Ireland national team, serving as captain on several occasions. After retiring as a player, O'Connell became a successful manager, leading several clubs to promotion and silverware. His most notable achievement came in 1935 when he guided Real Betis to their first and only La Liga title, becoming the first Irishman to win a major European league. O'Connell also managed several other Spanish clubs, including Racing Santander, Sevilla, and Barcelona. O'Connell's legacy extends beyond his success on the pitch. In 1922, he led a team of Irish players on a tour of South America, which helped to popularize football in the region and establish the sport as a cultural phenomenon. O'Connell also played a key role in saving Barcelona from financial ruin during the Spanish Civil War, using his connections with the Republican government to secure funding for the club. Despite his achievements, O'Connell's life was marked by tragedy and hardship. He struggled with alcoholism and financial difficulties throughout his career, and was forced to flee Spain in 1939 following the victory of Franco's forces in the Civil War. O'Connell spent the rest of his life in poverty, working odd jobs and living in obscurity. It was only after his death in 1959 that his contributions to football were fully recognized, with tributes pouring in from around the world. Today, O'Connell is remembered as one of the greatest Irish footballers and managers of all time, and a true pioneer of the sport.",

Shakur's music often addressed issues of racism, poverty, and violence in inner-city communities, and he became a symbol of resistance and empowerment for many young people.

He was involved in several high-profile feuds with other rappers, including The Notorious B.I.G. and his label, Bad Boy Records. Shakur was also known for his legal troubles, including multiple arrests and a prison sentence for sexual assault. Despite these challenges, he continued to release critically acclaimed albums and remained a popular and influential figure in hip hop until his untimely death in 1996. Shakur's legacy has continued to grow in the years since his death, with many artists citing him as a major influence on their own work.
