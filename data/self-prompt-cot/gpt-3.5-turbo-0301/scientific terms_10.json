            "passage": "An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists natural experimental studies. A child may carry out basic experiments to understand gravity, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance their understanding of a phenomenon. Experiments and other types of hands-on activities are very important to student learning in the science classroom. Experiments can raise test scores and help a student become more engaged and interested in the material they are learning, especially when used over time. Experiments can vary from personal and informal natural comparisons (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly controlled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists that hope to discover information about subatomic particles). Uses of experiments vary considerably between the natural and human sciences. Experiments typically include controls, which are designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable. This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements. Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method. Ideally, all variables in an experiment are controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none are uncontrolled. In such an experiment, if all controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment works as intended, and that results are due to the effect of the tested variable. In the scientific method, an experiment is an empirical procedure that arbitrates competing models or hypotheses. However, an experiment may also aim to answer a \"what-if\" question, without a specific expectation about what the experiment reveals, or to confirm prior results. If an experiment is carefully conducted, the results usually either support or disprove the hypothesis.",

It involves a range of techniques and methods that are used to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in data, and to draw conclusions and make predictions based on these findings. Data analysis is an important part of many fields, including business, science, engineering, and social sciences. It is used to inform decision-making, to evaluate the effectiveness of programs and interventions, and to identify areas for improvement. There are many different techniques and methods that can be used for data analysis, depending on the type of data being analyzed and the questions being asked. Some common techniques include statistical analysis, data mining, machine learning, and visualization. Statistical analysis involves using mathematical models and techniques to analyze data and draw conclusions. This can include techniques such as regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and analysis of variance. Data mining involves using algorithms and statistical models to identify patterns and relationships in large datasets. This can be used to identify trends, predict future outcomes, and identify areas for improvement. Machine learning involves using algorithms and statistical models to analyze data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. This can be used for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. Visualization involves using graphical representations of data to help people understand and interpret it. This can include techniques such as charts, graphs, and maps. Data analysis is an iterative process, meaning that it often involves multiple rounds of analysis and refinement. This can involve refining research questions, collecting additional data, or adjusting analysis techniques. Overall, data analysis is a critical tool for understanding and making decisions based on data. It involves a range of techniques and methods that can be used to extract useful information from data, and to inform decision-making in a variety of fields.",
