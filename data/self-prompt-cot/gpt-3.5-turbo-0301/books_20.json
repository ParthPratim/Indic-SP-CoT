First published in 1925, it is set on Long Island's North Shore and in New York City from spring to autumn of 1922. The novel takes place following the First World War. American society enjoyed prosperity during the \"Roaring Twenties\" as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers. After its publication, The Great Gatsby became a critical and popular success, though Fitzgerald was disappointed by its lack of commercial success. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades.",

It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, and has become a classic of modern American literature. The novel is set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Great Depression, and is narrated by the young Scout Finch. The story revolves around the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. Atticus Finch, Scout's father, is appointed as Tom's defense attorney, and the trial becomes a focal point for the town's racial tensions. Despite Atticus's efforts to prove Tom's innocence, he is ultimately found guilty and sentenced to death. To Kill a Mockingbird is widely regarded as a masterpiece of American literature, and is often taught in schools as a classic example of the coming-of-age genre. The novel explores themes of racism, prejudice, and injustice, as well as the importance of empathy and understanding. The character of Atticus Finch has become an iconic figure in American culture, representing the ideal of the principled and courageous lawyer. The novel has been adapted into numerous stage productions and films, including the 1962 film starring Gregory Peck as Atticus. Despite its critical and commercial success, To Kill a Mockingbird has also been the subject of controversy. Some critics have accused the novel of perpetuating a \"white savior\" narrative, in which a white character is portrayed as the hero who saves black characters from their own oppression. Others have criticized the novel's portrayal of black characters as passive and subservient. Despite these criticisms, To Kill a Mockingbird remains a beloved and influential work of American literature, and continues to be read and studied by generations of readers.",

            "term": "Pride and Prejudice",
            "passage": "Pride and Prejudice is a novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she navigates the social norms and expectations of 19th century England. The novel is set in the fictional town of Meryton and focuses on the relationships between the Bennet family and their acquaintances, particularly the wealthy and eligible Mr. Darcy. The novel is known for its witty dialogue, social commentary, and exploration of themes such as love, marriage, class, and gender roles. Austen's writing style is characterized by her use of irony and satire, which she employs to critique the societal norms of her time. The plot of Pride and Prejudice revolves around the Bennet family, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their five daughters: Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia. The family's main concern is finding suitable husbands for their daughters, as their estate is entailed to a male heir and they have no sons. The arrival of Mr. Bingley, a wealthy and amiable bachelor, in the neighborhood sets off a chain of events that leads to the eventual courtship of Jane and Mr. Bingley, as well as the tumultuous relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth initially dislikes Mr. Darcy due to his pride and arrogance, but as she gets to know him better, she realizes that her initial prejudices were unfounded. Throughout the novel, Austen explores the societal expectations placed on women in 19th century England, particularly in regards to marriage. Elizabeth is a strong-willed and independent character who challenges these expectations, refusing to marry for financial security or social status. Her eventual marriage to Mr. Darcy is based on mutual respect and love, rather than societal pressure. Pride and Prejudice has been adapted into numerous film, television, and stage productions, and is considered a classic of English literature. The novel's enduring popularity is a testament to Austen's skill as a writer and her ability to capture the complexities of human relationships and societal norms.",

The story is set on a farm in England, where the animals overthrow their human owner and establish a socialist society. However, the pigs, who take on the role of leaders, become corrupt and oppressive, leading to a dictatorship. The novel is a critique of the Soviet Union under Stalin, and the failure of the socialist ideals that inspired the revolution. Orwell was a socialist himself, but he was critical of the way that the Soviet Union had betrayed the principles of socialism. Animal Farm is a warning against the dangers of totalitarianism and the need for vigilance against the abuse of power. The characters in Animal Farm are all animals, each representing a different group of people in the Soviet Union. The pigs, led by Napoleon and Snowball, represent the Communist Party and its leaders. The other animals represent the working class, the peasants, and the intellectuals. The novel shows how the pigs use propaganda, violence, and manipulation to maintain their power, and how the other animals are gradually oppressed and exploited. Animal Farm is a powerful and influential work of literature, and it has been translated into many languages. It is often taught in schools as an example of political allegory and satire. The novel has been adapted into several films, plays, and other media, and it remains a popular and relevant work today.",

The novel is set in a future society where people are genetically engineered and conditioned to conform to a rigid social hierarchy. The story follows the lives of several characters, including Bernard Marx, a member of the ruling class who is dissatisfied with his life, and John, a \"savage\" from a reservation who is brought to the civilized world and struggles to adapt. The novel explores themes of individuality, freedom, and the dangers of a society that values conformity over individuality. It also critiques the idea of a utopian society, arguing that such a society would require the sacrifice of individuality and freedom. The society depicted in Brave New World is divided into castes, with each caste being genetically engineered and conditioned to perform a specific role in society. The ruling class, known as the Alphas, are intelligent and physically superior, while the lower castes are less intelligent and physically inferior. The society is also heavily controlled through the use of drugs, such as soma, which is used to suppress negative emotions and maintain social stability. The novel's protagonist, Bernard Marx, is an Alpha who is dissatisfied with his life and the rigid social hierarchy. He becomes interested in John, a \"savage\" from a reservation who has not been genetically engineered or conditioned. Bernard brings John to the civilized world, hoping to use him as a way to gain fame and power. However, John struggles to adapt to the new society and becomes disillusioned with its values. The novel's climax occurs when John, disgusted with the society's values, incites a riot and is ultimately killed. The novel ends with the ruling class using John's death as a way to reinforce their control over society. Brave New World has been widely praised for its critique of a society that values conformity over individuality. It has also been criticized for its portrayal of women and its use of racial stereotypes. Despite these criticisms, the novel remains a classic of dystopian literature and continues to be studied and discussed today.",

It is considered a classic of children's literature and is the author's best-known work, having sold over 100 million copies in 47 languages. Written between 1949 and 1954, the series is set in the fictional realm of Narnia, a world of magic, mythical beasts, and talking animals. Each book tells a different story, but all are set in the same universe and feature recurring characters. The series begins with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which tells the story of four siblings who discover a magical wardrobe that leads to the land of Narnia. There they meet Aslan, a wise and powerful lion who is the true ruler of Narnia. The children become embroiled in a battle between Aslan and the evil White Witch, who has cursed Narnia with eternal winter. The story is a Christian allegory, with Aslan representing Jesus Christ and the White Witch representing Satan. The second book, Prince Caspian, takes place hundreds of years after the events of the first book. The Pevensie siblings return to Narnia to help Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to the throne, reclaim his kingdom from his evil uncle. The third book, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, follows the adventures of Lucy and Edmund as they join their cousin Eustace on a voyage to the edge of the world. The fourth book, The Silver Chair, introduces a new protagonist, a boy named Eustace who returns to Narnia with his friend Jill to rescue Prince Rilian, the son of King Caspian, who has been kidnapped by an evil witch. The fifth book, The Horse and His Boy, takes place during the events of the first book and tells the story of a young boy named Shasta who escapes from his cruel adoptive father and sets out on a journey to Narnia. The sixth book, The Magician's Nephew, is a prequel to the series and tells the story of how Narnia was created. It follows the adventures of two children, Digory and Polly, as they explore different worlds and accidentally unleash an evil queen on Narnia. The final book, The Last Battle, takes place many years after the events of the previous books and tells the story of a false Aslan who leads Narnia into a final battle between good and evil.",

The story is set in the early 20th century and follows the life of Mary Lennox, a young girl who is orphaned after her parents die of cholera in India. She is sent to live with her uncle, Archibald Craven, at his estate in Yorkshire, England. Mary is a spoiled and unhappy child who has never known love or affection. She is initially unhappy at the prospect of living in a strange place with people she does not know. The estate is a large and sprawling place with many gardens, including a walled garden that has been locked up for years. Mary becomes curious about the garden and eventually discovers the key to the door. She enters the garden and finds it overgrown and neglected. She decides to make it her own and begins to clean it up. She meets a boy named Dickon who helps her with the garden. He is a kind and gentle boy who has a way with animals. Mary also discovers that her cousin, Colin, is living in the house. Colin is a sickly boy who has been confined to his bed for most of his life. He is convinced that he is going to die and is very unhappy. Mary and Dickon decide to bring Colin to the garden and show him the beauty of nature. They help him to see that he is not going to die and that he can live a full and happy life. As the story progresses, Mary, Colin, and Dickon become close friends and work together to make the garden beautiful. They also discover the secret of the garden, which is that it was once a place of great beauty and joy, but was locked up after a tragedy occurred. The tragedy involved Archibald Craven's wife, who died in the garden. Archibald was so grief-stricken that he locked up the garden and refused to let anyone enter it. The Secret Garden is a story about the power of nature to heal and transform. It is also a story about the importance of friendship and love. The novel has been adapted into several films, stage plays, and musicals. It is considered a classic of children's literature and has been beloved by generations of readers.",

The story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she navigates the social norms and expectations of 19th century England. The novel is set in the fictional town of Meryton, where Elizabeth and her four sisters live with their parents. The Bennet family is of modest means, and their main goal is to marry off their daughters to wealthy suitors. The novel is known for its witty dialogue and social commentary, as well as its exploration of themes such as love, marriage, and class. The main conflict of the story revolves around Elizabeth's relationship with Mr. Darcy, a wealthy and proud gentleman who initially looks down on Elizabeth and her family. Despite their initial animosity towards each other, the two eventually come to understand and appreciate each other's virtues. Throughout the novel, Austen satirizes the social conventions of her time, particularly the emphasis on marriage as a means of securing financial stability and social status. She also critiques the rigid class system of 19th century England, highlighting the limitations it places on individuals and their ability to pursue their own happiness. Pride and Prejudice has been adapted numerous times for film, television, and stage, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest works of English literature. Its enduring popularity is a testament to Austen's skill as a writer and her ability to capture the complexities of human relationships and societal norms.",

            "passage": "To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee, published in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, and has become a classic of modern American literature. The novel is set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Great Depression, and follows the story of Scout Finch, a young girl growing up in the town. The novel is narrated by Scout, who is six years old at the beginning of the story. She lives with her father, Atticus Finch, a lawyer, and her older brother, Jem. The novel is divided into two parts, with the first part focusing on Scout's childhood and the second part on a trial in which Atticus defends a black man accused of raping a white woman. The novel deals with themes of racism, prejudice, and injustice, as well as the loss of innocence and the coming of age of the main character. The title of the novel comes from a conversation between Atticus and Scout, in which he tells her that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, as they do nothing but sing and bring joy to the world. To Kill a Mockingbird has been praised for its portrayal of the South during the Great Depression, as well as its exploration of the themes of racism and prejudice. The novel has been adapted into a successful film, as well as a stage play, and has been translated into more than 40 languages. The novel has also been the subject of controversy, with some critics arguing that it perpetuates stereotypes of African Americans and reinforces the idea of the white savior. However, others have defended the novel, arguing that it is a powerful critique of racism and prejudice, and that it remains relevant today. Despite the controversy, To Kill a Mockingbird remains one of the most widely read and beloved novels in American literature, and continues to be taught in schools and universities around the world.",

            "passage": "The Great Gatsby is a novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that was first published in 1925. The novel is set in the summer of 1922 in the fictional town of West Egg on Long Island. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, a young man from the Midwest who has moved to New York City to pursue a career in the bond business. The novel explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as both glamorous and grotesque. The central character is Jay Gatsby, a wealthy and mysterious man who throws lavish parties in an attempt to win back his former love, Daisy Buchanan, who is now married to Tom Buchanan, a wealthy and arrogant man. The novel is widely regarded as a masterpiece of American literature and is considered one of the greatest works of the 20th century. It has been adapted into numerous films, stage productions, and television shows, and has been the subject of countless academic studies and critical analyses. Fitzgerald drew heavily on his own experiences and observations of the social and cultural milieu of the 1920s to create the world of The Great Gatsby. He was particularly interested in the excesses and contradictions of the era, and the tension between the old and new worlds that characterized it. The novel is notable for its vivid and evocative descriptions of the parties and social gatherings that take place throughout the story. Fitzgerald's prose is often lyrical and poetic, and he uses a variety of literary techniques to create a sense of atmosphere and mood. The Great Gatsby has been praised for its complex characters, intricate plot, and rich symbolism. The novel is often read as a critique of the American Dream, and the disillusionment and corruption that can result from the pursuit of wealth and status. Despite its initial mixed reception, The Great Gatsby has become one of the most widely read and studied works of American literature. It continues to resonate with readers today, and its themes and characters have become iconic symbols of the Jazz Age and the American Dream.",

The story is narrated by Holden Caulfield, a teenage boy who has been expelled from his prep school. The novel is widely regarded as a classic of American literature and has been translated into many languages. The novel is set in the 1950s and follows Holden as he wanders around New York City, trying to make sense of his life and the world around him. He is disillusioned with the adult world and feels alienated from his peers. Throughout the novel, Holden struggles with his own identity and his place in the world. The title of the novel comes from a song called \"Comin' Thro' the Rye,\" which Holden misinterprets. He imagines himself as the \"catcher in the rye,\" a person who stands at the edge of a cliff and catches children who are about to fall off. This image represents Holden's desire to protect innocence and his fear of growing up. The novel has been both praised and criticized for its portrayal of teenage angst and rebellion. Some critics have accused Salinger of glorifying Holden's rebellious behavior, while others have praised the novel for its honesty and authenticity. Despite the controversy surrounding the novel, it has remained popular with readers and has been adapted into several films and stage productions. The Catcher in the Rye continues to be studied in schools and universities around the world, and is considered a classic of American literature.",

Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike. With the publications of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled Sanditon, but died before its completion.

He is best known as the author of the classic high fantasy works The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (now Free State Province in South Africa) to Arthur Tolkien, an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, née Suffield. They had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894. When he was three, Tolkien went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could join them. This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham. He enjoyed exploring Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with places such as the village of Tormarton in South Gloucestershire, the name of which he used in The Hobbit. Tolkien was educated at King Edward's School in Birmingham and later St. Philip's School. In 1904, when Tolkien was 12, his mother died of acute diabetes at Fern Cottage in Rednal, which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with diabetes mellitus type 1 could live without treatment—insulin would not be discovered until two decades later. Tolkien spent the rest of his childhood in Birmingham and later in the boarding house of a Mrs. Faulkner in the seaside town of Bournemouth. Tolkien attended University College, Oxford, where he studied Classics and English literature and eventually received a first-class degree in 1915.",

Frodo is described as a small and unassuming hobbit, with curly brown hair and bright blue eyes. He is kind-hearted and loyal, but also prone to fear and doubt.

He becomes increasingly weary and despondent, and at times even succumbs to the Ring's power. In the end, Frodo is able to destroy the Ring, but at a great cost to himself.

Smaug engages Bilbo in a battle of wits, trying to trick him into revealing the dwarves' plans and whereabouts. However, Bilbo manages to outsmart Smaug and escape with his life. Later, the dwarves and the human Bard the Bowman launch a full-scale attack on Smaug, using a specially-made arrow that is said to be the only weapon capable of killing the dragon. After a fierce battle, Bard manages to shoot Smaug in the one vulnerable spot on his body, killing him and allowing the dwarves to reclaim their treasure. Smaug has become one of the most iconic and memorable villains in fantasy literature, and has been adapted into various forms of media, including films, television shows, and video games.

Her father, Patrick Bronte, was a clergyman and her mother, Maria Branwell, was an artist. Bronte and her siblings were educated at home by their father and later attended a boarding school in Brussels. Bronte's literary career began in 1846 when she and her sisters, Charlotte and Anne, published a collection of poems under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. The following year, Bronte published \"Wuthering Heights,\" a novel that was met with mixed reviews but has since become a classic of English literature. The novel tells the story of the passionate and destructive love between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and explores themes of revenge, social class, and the supernatural. Despite the success of \"Wuthering Heights,\" Bronte did not live to see its enduring popularity. She died in 1848 at the age of 30, possibly from tuberculosis. Bronte's legacy as a writer has continued to grow in the years since her death, with \"Wuthering Heights\" inspiring countless adaptations and interpretations in literature, film, and other media.

Despite initially being seen as a moderate figure within the Bolshevik Party, Stalin eventually rose to power through a combination of political maneuvering and ruthless tactics, including the purging of his political rivals and the establishment of a cult of personality around himself. Under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet Union underwent rapid industrialization and collectivization, but also suffered from widespread famine, political repression, and human rights abuses.

Unlike his fellow Alphas, Bernard is physically smaller and less attractive, which leads to him being ostracized and feeling like an outsider. He is also more introspective and critical of the society's values and practices, which leads him to question the use of soma, the drug that is used to control the population's emotions. Bernard's dissatisfaction with his life leads him to seek out John, a man from the \"Savage Reservation\" who has been brought to the World State. Bernard sees John as a way to gain fame and recognition, and he brings him back to London to show him off to his colleagues. However, things do not go as planned, and Bernard's attempt to use John for his own purposes backfires. Throughout the novel, Bernard struggles with his own identity and his place in society. He is torn between his desire to fit in and be accepted and his need to express his individuality and be true to himself. In the end, Bernard's attempts to rebel against the society he lives in are ultimately unsuccessful, and he is forced to conform or face exile. Bernard Marx is a complex and multi-dimensional character who represents the struggle between individuality and conformity. His story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of sacrificing one's own identity for the sake of fitting in with society's norms and expectations.",

The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, with small amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases. The atmospheric pressure varies at different layers and is about 1 atm at sea level. Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere, oceans, and other abiotic factors, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful solar radiation, permitting life on land.

Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike. With the publications of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled Sanditon, but died before its completion.

During his lifetime, he published four novels, four collections of short stories, and 164 short stories. Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune in the 1920s, Fitzgerald only received critical acclaim after his death. He is now widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. Fitzgerald is considered a member of the \"Lost Generation\" of the 1920s. He finished four novels: This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, The Great Gatsby (his most famous), and Tender Is the Night. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Last Tycoon, was published posthumously. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that treat themes of youth and promise along with despair and age.",
