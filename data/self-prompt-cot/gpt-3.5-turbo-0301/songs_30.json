            "passage": "Stairway to Heaven is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released in 1971. It was composed by guitarist Jimmy Page and vocalist Robert Plant for the band's fourth studio album, Led Zeppelin IV. The song is often considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time and has become a staple of classic rock radio. Stairway to Heaven is a progressive rock song that features a slow, acoustic guitar intro that gradually builds in intensity and complexity. The song's lyrics are mystical and poetic, drawing on themes of spirituality, mythology, and the afterlife. The song's title is a reference to the biblical story of Jacob's ladder, which describes a stairway that reaches from Earth to Heaven. The song's iconic guitar solo, played by Jimmy Page, is widely regarded as one of the greatest guitar solos in rock history. The solo features a series of intricate and melodic runs that showcase Page's technical skill and musicality. The solo builds to a climax with a series of soaring notes that perfectly capture the song's sense of transcendence and spiritual elevation. Stairway to Heaven has been covered by numerous artists and has been featured in countless films, TV shows, and commercials. The song's enduring popularity is a testament to its timeless appeal and its ability to resonate with listeners across generations. Despite its popularity, Stairway to Heaven has also been the subject of controversy. In 2016, the song was at the center of a high-profile copyright infringement lawsuit, in which the estate of Randy California, the late guitarist of the band Spirit, claimed that Led Zeppelin had plagiarized the opening chords of Stairway to Heaven from Spirit's song \"Taurus.\" The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed, but it sparked a debate about the boundaries of copyright law and the ethics of borrowing from other artists. Regardless of its legal controversies, Stairway to Heaven remains a beloved and iconic song that continues to inspire and captivate listeners around the world.",

            "passage": "Bohemian Rhapsody is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. The song is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a complex and intricate piece of music, featuring layered vocals, multiple guitar parts, and a wide range of musical styles. Bohemian Rhapsody was a commercial and critical success upon its release, reaching number one in the UK charts and becoming one of Queen's most popular songs. It has since become a cultural phenomenon, with its iconic opening piano chords and memorable lyrics being recognized around the world. The song's lyrics are famously enigmatic, with Mercury himself describing them as \"just a bunch of random rhyming nonsense\". However, many interpretations have been suggested over the years, with some seeing the song as a reflection on Mercury's personal life, while others see it as a commentary on the state of the world at the time. The song's operatic section, featuring Mercury's multi-tracked vocals, has become one of the most famous moments in rock music history. The section was inspired by Mercury's love of opera, and features a pastiche of different styles, including Italian opera, English balladry, and even a brief nod to the Beach Boys. Bohemian Rhapsody has been covered and parodied countless times over the years, and has been used in numerous films, TV shows, and commercials. It was also the inspiration for the title of the 2018 biopic about Mercury and Queen, which went on to become a box office success and win several awards. Despite its age, Bohemian Rhapsody remains a beloved and iconic song, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest pieces of music ever recorded. Its enduring popularity is a testament to the talent and creativity of Freddie Mercury and the rest of Queen, and their ability to create music that transcends time and genre.",

The song was released as the lead single from The Bodyguard soundtrack and quickly became a worldwide hit, topping the charts in multiple countries and winning numerous awards, including a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. \"I Will Always Love You\" has since become one of the most iconic and beloved songs of all time, with its emotional lyrics and soaring melody resonating with audiences across generations.

It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. The unexpected success of the song propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where grunge entered the mainstream. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl. The song's lyrics and accompanying music video, directed by Samuel Bayer, were intended as a parody of the mainstream music industry and its culture. The song's title is a reference to a deodorant marketed to teenagers, and the lyrics contain a mix of nonsensical phrases and social commentary. The song's distinctive opening riff, played by Novoselic on bass, has become one of the most recognizable in rock music history. The song's chorus, with Cobain's anguished vocals singing \"Here we are now, entertain us,\" has been interpreted as a commentary on the apathy and boredom of Generation X. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was a critical and commercial success, and has since been widely regarded as one of the greatest songs of all time. It has been covered by numerous artists, and has been featured in films, television shows, and video games. The song's impact on popular culture has been compared to that of the Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel.\" Despite its success, Cobain grew to resent the song's popularity and the attention it brought to the band. In a 1993 interview with Rolling Stone, he said, \"I'm embarrassed by it now. It's a cliché. It's been beaten to death. It's been parodied.\"",

            "passage": "\"Like a Rolling Stone\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on July 20, 1965, by Columbia Records. Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album Highway 61 Revisited. During a difficult two-day preproduction, Dylan struggled to find the essence of the song, which was demoed without success in 3/4 time. A breakthrough was made when it was tried in a rock music format, and rookie session musician Al Kooper improvised the organ riff for which the track is known. However, Columbia Records was unhappy with both the song's length at over six minutes and its heavy electric sound, and was hesitant to release it. It was only when a month later a copy was leaked to a new popular music club and heard by influential DJs that the song was put out as a single. Although radio stations were reluctant to play such a long track, \"Like a Rolling Stone\" reached number two in the US charts and became a worldwide hit. Critics have described the track as revolutionary in its combination of different musical elements, the youthful, cynical sound of Dylan's voice, and the directness of the question \"How does it feel?\" \"Like a Rolling Stone\" transformed Dylan's career and is today considered one of the most influential compositions in postwar popular music. It has been covered by numerous artists, from The Rolling Stones to Jimi Hendrix to Green Day, and was ranked as the greatest song of all time by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004.

The origins of the word Hallelujah can be traced back to the Hebrew Bible, where it appears numerous times in the Book of Psalms. In these passages, the word is used as a call to worship or as an expression of praise and thanksgiving to God. The word is also used in the New Testament, particularly in the Book of Revelation, where it is used to describe the worship of God in heaven. Over time, the word Hallelujah has become a popular expression of joy and celebration in secular contexts as well. It has been used in music, literature, and other forms of art to express a range of emotions, from exuberant joy to solemn reverence. One of the most famous musical compositions featuring the word Hallelujah is the song of the same name by Leonard Cohen. Originally released in 1984, the song has since become a beloved classic, covered by countless artists and featured in numerous films and television shows.

            "passage": "\"Hey Jude\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney. The ballad evolved from \"Hey Jules\", a song McCartney wrote to comfort John Lennon's son, Julian, during his parents' divorce. McCartney later said, \"I started with the idea 'Hey Jules,' which was Julian, don't make it bad, take a sad song and make it better. Hey, try and deal with this terrible thing. I knew it was not going to be easy for him. I always feel sorry for kids in divorces ... I had the idea [for the song] by the time I got there. I changed it to 'Jude' because I thought that sounded a bit better.\" The song was released in August 1968 as the first single from the Beatles' record label Apple Records. More than seven minutes in length, it was at the time the longest single ever to top the British charts. It also spent nine weeks at number one in the United States, the longest for any Beatles single. \"Hey Jude\" tied the \"all-time\" record, at the time, for the longest run at the top of the US charts. The single has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on professional critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time. In 2013, Billboard named it the 10th biggest song of all time. The song's arrangement was by George Martin and has been described as a \"pop hymn\". It features a single verse and a long coda, with the coda being repeated several times. The song was recorded during the sessions for the Beatles' self-titled double album, commonly known as \"the White Album\", but was not included on the album's original release. It was later released on the compilation album Hey Jude in 1970. McCartney performed \"Hey Jude\" several times with his post-Beatles band Wings. He also performed the song live with Elton John, at John's 1987 concert at Wembley Stadium, London, and with Bruce Springsteen, at the Hard Rock Calling festival in London in 2012. McCartney has also performed the song at several benefit concerts, including Live Aid in 1985, the Concert for New York City in 2001, and the One World: Together at Home concert in 2020.",

            "passage": "Let It Be is the twelfth and final studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 8 May 1970, almost a month after the group's break-up, in tandem with the motion picture of the same name. Like most of the band's previous releases, the album topped record charts in many countries, including both the US and the UK. However, it received mixed reviews from music critics and fans alike, with some praising its raw, stripped-down sound and others criticizing its lack of cohesion and production values. The album was recorded in early 1969, during a tumultuous period for the band. The Beatles had just completed their previous album, Abbey Road, and tensions were high between the members. The sessions for Let It Be were initially intended to be a return to the band's roots, with the group recording live in the studio and eschewing the elaborate production techniques of their recent albums. However, the sessions quickly became fraught with disagreements and arguments, with the band members often working separately and only coming together sporadically. The album's title track, \"Let It Be,\" was one of the last songs recorded for the album and became one of the band's most iconic and enduring hits. The song was written by Paul McCartney and inspired by a dream he had in which his mother, who had died when he was a teenager, came to him and told him to \"let it be.\" The song's gospel-inflected sound and uplifting message struck a chord with audiences and helped to cement the Beatles' place in the pantheon of rock and roll legends. Other notable tracks on the album include \"Get Back,\" which was originally intended as a single but was later included on the album, and \"The Long and Winding Road,\" which was heavily produced by Phil Spector and became a controversial point of contention between McCartney and the other members of the band. The album also includes several tracks that were recorded during the band's famous rooftop concert, which took place on the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters in London in January 1969. Despite its mixed reception, Let It Be remains a beloved and influential album in the Beatles' discography. Its raw, unpolished sound and emphasis on live performance helped to pave the way for the rise of punk rock and other DIY genres in the years to come. The album also serves as a poignant reminder of the band's final days together, and the tensions and conflicts that ultimately led to their break-up.",

Chandeliers have been used for centuries to light up grand spaces such as palaces, churches, and ballrooms. They were a symbol of wealth and status, and the more elaborate the chandelier, the more prestigious the owner. In the 18th century, chandeliers became more popular in homes, and they were often made of crystal or glass to reflect the light and create a dazzling effect. Today, chandeliers come in a wide variety of styles and sizes, from small and simple to large and ornate. They can be made of crystal, glass, metal, or even plastic. Some chandeliers are designed to be modern and minimalist, while others are more traditional and ornate. Chandeliers are often used in dining rooms, living rooms, and entryways, but they can be used in any room where a dramatic lighting effect is desired. They can be hung from a ceiling or mounted on a wall, and they can be controlled by a dimmer switch to create different moods and atmospheres. In addition to their decorative function, chandeliers can also provide practical lighting. They can be used to light up a large space or to highlight a specific area, such as a dining table or a piece of artwork.

The song is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a blend of progressive rock, hard rock, and opera, and has been described as \"the most significant single work in the history of rock music\". The song was released as a single in the UK on 31 October 1975, and became a commercial success, reaching number one in the UK Singles Chart and staying there for nine weeks. It also reached number one in several other countries, including Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands. The song was re-released in 1991, following the death of Mercury, and reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" has been praised for its innovative structure, complex harmonies, and Mercury's vocal performance. The song has been covered by numerous artists, and has been featured in several films, television shows, and commercials. The song's music video, directed by Bruce Gowers, is also considered a landmark in the history of music videos. The song's lyrics have been interpreted in various ways, with some suggesting that it is about Mercury's personal life, while others see it as a commentary on the state of the world at the time. The song's title is also a reference to the Bohemian lifestyle, which was associated with artists and intellectuals in the 19th century. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" has been recognized as one of the greatest songs of all time, and has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\", and the UK Music Hall of Fame.",

Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 solar days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.256 times. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, with small amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases. The atmospheric pressure varies at different layers and is about 1 atm at sea level. Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere, oceans, and other abiotic factors, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful solar radiation, permitting life on land.

The group consisted of vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has been described as a mix of blues, rock, and folk music, and their innovative use of amplification and effects has had a lasting impact on the development of rock music. Led Zeppelin's early albums, including their self-titled debut and the follow-up Led Zeppelin II, were characterized by their raw energy and blues-based riffing. The band's later work, such as the epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" and the hard-hitting \"Kashmir,\" showcased their more experimental side, incorporating elements of folk, world music, and even orchestral arrangements. Despite their success, Led Zeppelin was not without controversy. The band was accused of plagiarism on several occasions, most notably for their use of uncredited samples from blues artists such as Willie Dixon and Howlin' Wolf. In addition, their reputation for wild partying and excess led to clashes with authorities and a number of legal troubles. Despite these challenges, Led Zeppelin remains one of the most influential and beloved rock bands of all time. Their music continues to inspire new generations of musicians, and their legacy as pioneers of heavy rock and roll is secure.",

Their classic line-up consisted of Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), John Deacon (bass guitar), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name \"Queen\". Deacon was recruited before the band recorded their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format. The band's 1977 album News of the World contained \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. \"Another One Bites the Dust\" (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England. In 1991, he died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since then, May and Taylor have infrequently performed together, including a collaboration with Paul Rodgers under the name Queen + Paul Rodgers which ended in May 2009. The band has released a total of 18 number-one albums, 18 number-one singles, and 10 number-one DVDs. They have sold more than 150 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.",

            "passage": "Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods. Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western or eastern horizon during the early evening or early morning. At this time it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which reoccurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days. Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years. Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about ​1⁄30 of a degree). Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System; at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions. The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites.",

It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost 2 million square kilometers (over 760,000 square miles), Mexico is the fifth-largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 129 million people, it is the tenth most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and Mexico City, a special federal entity that is also the capital city and its most populous city. Other metropolises in the country include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, and Tijuana. Pre-Columbian Mexico traces its origins to 8,000 BC and is identified as one of six cradles of civilization; it was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations, most notably the Maya and the Aztecs. In 1521, the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain. Three centuries later, Mexico achieved independence from Spain in 1821. The post-independence period was characterized by economic instability, territorial secession, and civil war, including foreign intervention, two empires, and two long domestic dictatorships. The latter led to the Mexican Revolution in 1910, which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution and the emergence of the country as a secular, democratic federal republic.",

The band became one of the most successful and influential in the history of popular music, with hits such as \"Hey Jude,\" \"Let It Be,\" and \"A Hard Day's Night.\" Lennon's songwriting was characterized by his wit, social commentary, and introspection. He wrote some of the Beatles' most beloved songs, including \"Imagine,\" \"All You Need Is Love,\" and \"Revolution.\" After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon embarked on a successful solo career, releasing albums such as Imagine and Mind Games. In addition to his music, Lennon was known for his activism and outspokenness on issues such as peace, civil rights, and the Vietnam War. He and his wife Yoko Ono famously staged a week-long \"bed-in for peace\" in 1969, and Lennon's song \"Give Peace a Chance\" became an anthem for the anti-war movement. Tragically, Lennon was assassinated outside his New York City apartment in 1980 by a mentally unstable fan.

In Hindu philosophy, it is the union with the divine ground of existence Brahman, and the experience of blissful egolessness. In Buddhist meditation, it is a state of emptiness or cessation of all mental activity, which is seen as a prerequisite for attaining enlightenment. The concept of Nirvana is central to Buddhist philosophy and is considered the ultimate goal of the Buddhist path. It is often described as a state of perfect happiness, freedom, and peace, beyond all suffering and impermanence. The attainment of Nirvana is said to be the end of the cycle of rebirth and the attainment of complete liberation from all forms of suffering. The concept of Nirvana has been a subject of debate and interpretation in Indian philosophy and has been interpreted in various ways by different schools of thought.",

The group's name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1975 to 1982. ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest. They are the most successful group to have taken part in the competition. ABBA's record sales figure is uncertain and various estimates range from over 140 million to over 500 million sold records. This makes them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. ABBA was the first group to come from a non-English-speaking country to enjoy consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and on a lesser scale, the United States. They have a joint record eight consecutive number-one albums in the UK. The group also enjoyed significant success in Latin America, and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish. During the band's active years, Fältskog and Ulvaeus were a married couple, as were Lyngstad and Andersson, although both couples later divorced. At the height of their popularity, both relationships were suffering strain which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the Ulvaeus–Fältskog marriage in 1979 and the Andersson–Lyngstad marriage in 1981. These relationship changes were reflected in the group's music, with later compositions featuring more introspective and dark lyrics. After ABBA disbanded in December 1982, Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success writing music for the stage, while Lyngstad and Fältskog pursued solo careers with mixed success.",
