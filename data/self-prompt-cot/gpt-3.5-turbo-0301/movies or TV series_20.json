The first season of Stranger Things was released on Netflix in July 2016, and was met with critical acclaim. The show's second season was released in October 2017, and its third season was released in July 2019. The series has been renewed for a fourth season, which is currently in production. Stranger Things has been praised for its strong performances, particularly those of Ryder and Brown, as well as its writing and direction. The show has also been noted for its representation of diverse characters, including a gay character and a character with a disability.

The show has also been the subject of numerous parodies and homages, including a sketch on Saturday Night Live and a Halloween-themed episode of The Simpsons. Overall, Stranger Things has been praised for its ability to capture the spirit of the 1980s while also telling a compelling and original story. The show's blend of horror, science fiction, and nostalgia has made it a hit with audiences and critics alike, and it has become one of Netflix's most popular original series.",

            "passage": "The Handmaid's Tale is a dystopian novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, first published in 1985. It is set in a near-future New England, in a totalitarian state resembling a theonomy, which has overthrown the United States government. The novel focuses on the journey of the handmaid Offred. Her name derives from the possessive form \"of Fred\"; handmaids are forbidden to use their birth names and must echo the male, or master, whom they serve. The novel explores themes of women in subjugation in a patriarchal society and the various means by which they gain individualism and independence. The novel's title echoes the component parts of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, which comprises a series of connected stories (\"The Merchant's Tale\", \"The Parson's Tale\", etc.). The Handmaid's Tale is structured into two parts, night and other various events. The novel is set in an indeterminate future, speculated to be around the year 2005, with a fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what was the United States but is now the Republic of Gilead. The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population. The story is told in the first person by a woman called Offred (literally Of-Fred). The character is one of a class of women kept for reproductive purposes and known as \"handmaids\" by the ruling class in an era of declining births due to sterility from pollution and sexually transmitted diseases. Offred describes her life during her third assignment as a handmaid, in this case to Fred (referred to as \"The Commander\"). Interspersed with her narratives of her present-day experiences are flashbacks of her life before and during the beginning of the revolution, including her failed attempt to escape to Canada with her husband and daughter, and her indoctrination into life as a handmaid. The novel concludes with a metafictional epilogue that explains that the events of the novel occurred shortly after the beginning of what is called \"the Gilead Period\". The epilogue is a transcript of a symposium held in 2195, discussing Gilead's treatment of women. The participants are all male scholars, who discuss Offred's reliability as a witness, and her story's significance for scholars of gender studies, cultural studies, and religious studies.",

The series follows the adventures of Geralt of Rivia, a \"witcher\" – a skilled monster hunter – as he navigates the political turmoil and supernatural dangers of a medieval-inspired world. The first book in the series, The Last Wish, was published in 1993, and the series has since grown to include eight novels and numerous short stories. The books have been translated into over 20 languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide. In addition to the books, The Witcher has also been adapted into a popular video game series by Polish developer CD Projekt Red. The first game, The Witcher, was released in 2007, and the series has since grown to include three main games and several spin-offs. The games have been praised for their immersive world-building, complex characters, and mature storytelling. They have also been criticized for their sometimes clunky gameplay mechanics and uneven pacing. In 2019, The Witcher was adapted into a Netflix original series starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia. The series has been praised for its faithful adaptation of the books, strong performances, and impressive production values. Despite its popularity, The Witcher has also been the subject of controversy. Sapkowski has been critical of the video game adaptations, claiming that he was not adequately compensated for the use of his intellectual property. He has also been accused of sexism and racism in his writing. Despite these controversies, The Witcher remains a beloved and influential series in the fantasy genre. Its rich world-building, complex characters, and mature storytelling have inspired countless imitators and continue to captivate audiences around the world.",
