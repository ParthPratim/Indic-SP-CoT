            "passage": "The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor within New York City, in the United States. The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886. The statue is of a woman holding a torch in her right hand and a tablet in her left hand, upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States, and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad. The statue is made of copper sheets, which are supported by an iron framework. The statue stands 151 feet (46 meters) tall, but with its pedestal and foundation, it reaches a height of 305 feet (93 meters). The statue weighs 225 tons (204 metric tons) and is made up of 300 copper sheets, each about 3/32 of an inch (2.4 millimeters) thick. The statue was shipped to the United States in crates and assembled on its pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The pedestal was designed by American architect Richard Morris Hunt. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886, in a ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland. The statue has undergone several restorations over the years, including a major restoration in the 1980s. The statue was closed to visitors for several years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, but reopened in 2004 with increased security measures. Today, the Statue of Liberty is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the United States, with millions of visitors each year. Visitors can climb to the top of the pedestal and take an elevator or stairs to the top of the statue's crown, where they can enjoy panoramic views of New York City and the harbor.",

            "passage": "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct. The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first to the second level. Although there are stairs to the third and highest level, these are usually closed to the public and it is generally only accessible by lift. The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior engineers who worked for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel. The inspiration for the design came from the Latting Observatory, a 50-foot (15 m) tower built in New York City in 1853.",

The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia. The Great Barrier Reef is home to an abundance of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, 600 species of coral, and numerous species of sharks, dolphins, turtles, and whales. It is also home to the world's largest population of dugongs, a marine mammal similar to a manatee. The reef was formed over millions of years by the accumulation of coral polyps, tiny animals that secrete a hard calcium carbonate skeleton. The reef is constantly evolving, with new coral growth and the erosion of older coral structures. The Great Barrier Reef is a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year. Activities such as snorkelling, scuba diving, and glass-bottom boat tours allow visitors to experience the beauty and diversity of the reef up close. However, the reef is also facing numerous threats, including climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are causing coral bleaching, a process in which coral expels the algae that live within its tissues, leading to the death of the coral. Pollution from agricultural runoff and coastal development can also harm the reef, while overfishing can disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem. Efforts are being made to protect the Great Barrier Reef, including the establishment of marine protected areas and the implementation of sustainable fishing practices. However, the future of the reef remains uncertain, and continued action is needed to ensure its survival for future generations.",

The canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park, the Kaibab National Forest, Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, the Hualapai Indian Reservation, the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the Grand Canyon area and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery. The Grand Canyon is a massive geological feature, and its geology is well studied and understood. The canyon was created by the Colorado River cutting a channel over millions of years, and is one of the most studied geologic landscapes in the world. The layers of rock exposed in the canyon provide a record of geologic events that span much of the Earth's history. The majority of the rocks in the Grand Canyon are sedimentary rocks, with the oldest dating back to the Precambrian period, over 1.7 billion years ago. The Grand Canyon is a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year. The South Rim of the Grand Canyon is the most accessible and most visited part of the canyon, with numerous viewpoints and trails for visitors to explore. The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is less accessible and less visited, but offers a more remote and rugged experience for those willing to make the journey. The Grand Canyon is also a popular destination for hiking, backpacking, rafting, and other outdoor activities. The Grand Canyon is also home to a diverse array of plant and animal life, with over 1,500 plant species and over 400 animal species found within the park. The park is home to several endangered species, including the California condor, humpback chub, and razorback sucker. The Grand Canyon is also an important cultural site for several Native American tribes, including the Havasupai, Hualapai, Navajo, and Hopi.

Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the \"Lost City of the Incas\" (a title more accurately applied to Vilcabamba), it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.

The construction of the Taj Mahal took over 20 years and involved the work of thousands of artisans and craftsmen. The marble used in the construction was brought from Rajasthan and the precious stones used in the inlay work were sourced from all over the world. The design of the Taj Mahal is a blend of Islamic, Persian, and Indian architectural styles. The main structure of the Taj Mahal is a large dome, which is surrounded by four smaller domes.

Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation. The building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point in Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Garden, and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Though its name suggests a single venue, the building comprises multiple performance venues which together are among the busiest performing arts centres in the world — hosting well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2 million people. Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, the site is visited by more than eight million people annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year. The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government. On 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site, having been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005.

It was established by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is widely considered to be the first national park in the world. The park spans an area of 2.2 million acres and is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including grizzly bears, wolves, bison, and elk. It also contains the largest concentration of geysers in the world, with over 500 geysers and hot springs. The most famous of these is Old Faithful, which erupts approximately every 90 minutes. Yellowstone is situated on top of a supervolcano, which has erupted three times in the past 2.1 million years. The most recent eruption occurred approximately 640,000 years ago and created the Yellowstone Caldera, which is a massive crater that measures approximately 30 by 45 miles. The park is also home to a number of other geological features, including the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, which is a 20-mile-long canyon that is up to 4,000 feet deep. The canyon is carved by the Yellowstone River and is known for its stunning waterfalls and colorful rock formations. Yellowstone is a popular destination for tourists, with over 4 million visitors each year. The park offers a wide range of activities, including hiking, camping, fishing, and wildlife watching. It also has a number of historic lodges and cabins that offer visitors a unique and authentic experience. In addition to its natural beauty, Yellowstone is also an important site for scientific research. The park is home to a number of research facilities and is a popular destination for scientists studying geology, ecology, and wildlife biology. Overall, Yellowstone National Park is a unique and important natural resource that offers visitors a glimpse into the natural wonders of the world. Its stunning landscapes, diverse wildlife, and geological features make it a must-see destination for anyone interested in the natural world.",

The word acropolis is derived from the Greek words ἄκρον (akron, \"highest point, extremity\") and πόλις (polis, \"city\"). Although the term acropolis is generic and there are many other acropoleis in Greece, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as \"The Acropolis\" without qualification. The Acropolis was formally proclaimed as the preeminent monument on the European Cultural Heritage list of monuments on 26 March 2007. The Acropolis is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the first such site in Greece, inscribed in 1987. The Acropolis is also a significant archaeological site and a major tourist attraction. Almost every visitor to Athens visits the Acropolis hill, which is visible from almost everywhere in the city. The Acropolis of Athens is located on a rocky outcrop above the city of Athens, with a height of about 150 meters (490 ft). The outcrop is surrounded by a natural amphitheatre of hills, which provides a natural defence for the citadel. The Acropolis is composed of several ancient buildings, the most famous of which is the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena. Other notable buildings on the Acropolis include the Propylaea, the Erechtheion, and the Temple of Athena Nike. The history of the Acropolis of Athens dates back to the Neolithic period, but the most significant period of construction and development occurred during the 5th century BC, when Athens was at the height of its power and influence. During this period, the Acropolis was transformed into a monumental complex of temples, sanctuaries, and public buildings, which served as the religious and cultural centre of Athens. The Acropolis of Athens has undergone many changes and renovations over the centuries, including damage caused by wars, earthquakes, and looting. The most significant restoration project was carried out in the 20th century, under the direction of the Greek architect Nikolaos Balanos. The restoration work included the removal of later additions and alterations, the replacement of missing or damaged parts, and the reinforcement of the structures to ensure their stability.",

It is composed of a ring of standing stones, each weighing around 25 tons, and is surrounded by a circular ditch and bank. The monument is believed to have been constructed between 3000 and 2000 BCE, during the Neolithic period. The purpose of Stonehenge is still a subject of debate among archaeologists and historians. Some believe it was a place of worship or a site for astronomical observation, while others suggest it was a burial ground or a place for healing. The monument's alignment with the solstices and equinoxes has led some to believe it was used as a calendar or for tracking the seasons. Stonehenge has undergone several phases of construction and modification over the centuries. The first phase, which began around 3000 BCE, involved the digging of a circular ditch and bank. The stones were erected in the second phase, which began around 2500 BCE. The stones were transported from quarries in Wales, over 150 miles away, and erected using a system of ropes, levers, and pulleys. The third phase, which began around 2100 BCE, involved the rearrangement of the stones into their current configuration. The monument was used for several centuries before falling into disuse around 1600 BCE. It was rediscovered in the 17th century and has since become one of the most famous and iconic landmarks in the world. Stonehenge has been the subject of much speculation and fascination over the centuries. It has been the inspiration for countless works of art, literature, and music, and has been the site of many rituals and ceremonies. Today, it is a popular tourist attraction and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",

The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The bridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. Originally it was painted a mid-greenish blue colour. The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made.

The park encompasses two active volcanoes: Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, and Mauna Loa, the world's most massive subaerial volcano. The park is also home to numerous other volcanic features, including lava tubes, cinder cones, and craters. The park was established in 1916, making it one of the oldest national parks in the United States. It covers an area of 323,431 acres (1,308.88 km2), including the summit of Mauna Loa at 13,677 feet (4,169 m) and the Kilauea Caldera, which is 2.4 miles (3.9 km) wide and 400 feet (120 m) deep. Kilauea has been erupting continuously since 1983, making it one of the most active volcanoes in the world. The eruption has created a constantly changing landscape, with new lava flows and volcanic features appearing regularly. Visitors to the park can witness this dynamic process firsthand, with guided hikes and ranger-led programs available to explore the park's volcanic features. The park is also home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including endangered species such as the Hawaiian goose (nene) and the Hawaiian bat (hoary bat). The park's unique ecosystem is the result of its location in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, far from any other landmass. In addition to its natural wonders, the park also has a rich cultural history. The park is home to numerous archaeological sites, including petroglyphs and ancient Hawaiian temples (heiau). The park's visitor center features exhibits on the park's geology, ecology, and cultural history, as well as a theater showing films about the park's natural and cultural resources. Overall, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is a unique and fascinating destination, offering visitors the opportunity to witness the power of nature firsthand and learn about the rich cultural history of the Hawaiian Islands.",

Established possibly as early as 312 BC as the capital city of the Nabataeans, it is a symbol of Jordan, as well as its most visited tourist attraction. It lies on the slope of Jebel al-Madhbah (identified by some as the biblical Mount Hor) in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah (Wadi Araba), the large valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Petra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. The site remained unknown to the Western world until 1812, when it was introduced by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. It was described as \"a rose-red city half as old as time\" in a Newdigate Prize-winning poem by John William Burgon. UNESCO has described it as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\". Petra was named amongst the New7Wonders of the World in 2007 and was also chosen by the Smithsonian Magazine as one of the \"28 Places to See Before You Die\". Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as its most visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked at 1 million in 2010, but had fallen to around 200,000 by 2019 due to regional instability. However, tourist numbers have been recovering since 2020. The site was closed to tourists for several months in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who took advantage of Petra's proximity to regional trade routes to establish it as a major trading hub. The Nabataeans are also known for their great ability in constructing efficient water-collecting methods in the barren deserts and their talent in carving structures into solid rocks.

The temple was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II as his state temple and capital city. It is located in the province of Siem Reap and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temple complex covers an area of 162.6 hectares and is surrounded by a moat that is 190 meters wide. The central temple is surrounded by a series of smaller temples and shrines, as well as a number of reservoirs and canals. The temple is built in the classical Khmer style, with five towers representing the five peaks of Mount Meru, the home of the gods in Hindu mythology. The temple is known for its intricate carvings and bas-reliefs, which depict scenes from Hindu mythology and the life of the Khmer people. The carvings cover almost every surface of the temple, including the walls, columns, and ceilings. The most famous of these carvings is the Churning of the Ocean of Milk, which depicts the gods and demons churning the ocean to create the elixir of immortality. The temple was abandoned in the 15th century and fell into disrepair. It was rediscovered in the 19th century by French explorers and has since been restored and preserved. Today, Angkor Wat is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Southeast Asia, attracting millions of visitors each year. Despite its popularity, the temple complex faces a number of challenges, including overcrowding, erosion, and damage from tourism. The Cambodian government and international organizations are working to address these issues and ensure the long-term preservation of this important cultural site.",

It is located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and Tibet. The first recorded attempt to climb Mount Everest was made in 1921 by a British expedition led by George Mallory. However, it was not until 1953 that the mountain was successfully climbed by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa of Nepal. Since then, thousands of climbers have attempted to reach the summit, with varying degrees of success. The climb to the summit of Mount Everest is considered one of the most challenging and dangerous mountaineering feats in the world. The extreme altitude, unpredictable weather conditions, and difficult terrain make it a formidable challenge for even the most experienced climbers. The climb typically takes several weeks, with climbers acclimatizing to the altitude and weather conditions before making their final push to the summit. Despite the risks, the allure of Mount Everest continues to draw climbers from around the world. In recent years, there has been controversy surrounding the commercialization of the mountain, with concerns about overcrowding, environmental damage, and the safety of climbers. Nevertheless, Mount Everest remains a symbol of human achievement and a testament to the power of the human spirit to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges.",

It is considered one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The falls are named after Queen Victoria, who was the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom at the time of their discovery in 1855 by Scottish explorer David Livingstone. The falls are approximately 1.7 kilometers wide and 108 meters high, making them the largest waterfall in the world in terms of the combined width and height of the falls. The water falls into a narrow gorge, which is up to 110 meters deep and 1.6 kilometers wide. The spray from the falls can be seen from up to 50 kilometers away and creates a permanent rainforest in the surrounding area. The falls are known locally as Mosi-oa-Tunya, which means \"the smoke that thunders.\" This name refers to the mist and noise created by the falling water, which can be heard from several kilometers away. The falls are a popular tourist destination and attract visitors from all over the world. There are several viewpoints from which visitors can view the falls, including the Devil's Pool, which is a natural pool located at the edge of the falls. Visitors can swim in the pool and look over the edge of the falls, but it is only accessible during the dry season when the water level is low. The falls are also a popular destination for adventure activities such as bungee jumping, white-water rafting, and helicopter tours. The surrounding area is home to a variety of wildlife, including elephants, buffalo, and hippos. The falls are fed by the Zambezi River, which flows through six countries before reaching the falls. The flow of water over the falls varies throughout the year, with the highest flow occurring during the rainy season from November to April. Despite their beauty, the falls have a dark history. The area was once home to the Makololo people, who were displaced by the arrival of European settlers in the 19th century. The falls were also the site of several battles during the colonial era, including the Battle of Livingstone in 1895. Today, the falls are a symbol of the natural beauty and cultural heritage of southern Africa.

The islands are known for their large number of endemic species and were studied by Charles Darwin during the second voyage of HMS Beagle. His observations and collections contributed to the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution by means of natural selection. The Galápagos Islands and their surrounding waters form the Galápagos Province of Ecuador, the Galápagos National Park, and the Galápagos Marine Reserve. The principal language on the islands is Spanish. The islands have a population of slightly over 25,000. The first recorded visit to the islands happened by chance in 1535, when the Bishop of Panamá Fray Tomás de Berlanga went to Peru to settle a dispute between Francisco Pizarro and his lieutenants. De Berlanga was blown off course, though he eventually returned to the Spanish Empire and described the conditions of the islands and the giant tortoises that inhabited them. The group of islands was shown and named in Abraham Ortelius's atlas published in 1570. The first crude map of the islands was made in 1684 by the buccaneer Ambrose Cowley, who named the individual islands after some of his fellow pirates or after the English noblemen who helped the privateer's cause. These names were used in the authoritative navigation charts of the islands prepared during the Beagle survey under captain Robert Fitzroy, and in Darwin's popular book The Voyage of the Beagle. The new Republic of Ecuador took the islands from Spanish ownership in 1832, and subsequently gave them official Spanish names. The older names remained in use in English language publications, including Herman Melville's The Encantadas of 1854. The islands are located at the Galápagos Triple Junction. The archipelago consists of 18 main islands, 3 smaller islands, and 107 rocks and islets. The islands are located at the eastern Pacific Ocean, 973 km (605 mi) off the west coast of South America.",

The mountain is composed of three distinct volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. Kibo is the highest and most well-known of the three, and is the only one that is currently dormant. Mount Kilimanjaro is a popular destination for hikers and climbers, attracting thousands of visitors each year. The mountain is located in Kilimanjaro National Park, which was established in 1973 to protect the area's unique flora and fauna. The park covers an area of 1,688 square kilometers (652 square miles) and is home to a variety of wildlife, including elephants, leopards, and buffalo. The first recorded ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro was in 1889 by German geographer Hans Meyer and Austrian mountaineer Ludwig Purtscheller. Since then, the mountain has become a popular destination for climbers from all over the world. The climb to the summit is not technically difficult, but it is physically demanding and requires a good level of fitness. There are several routes to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, each with its own unique features and challenges. The most popular routes are the Marangu, Machame, and Lemosho routes. The Marangu route is the easiest and most direct, while the Machame and Lemosho routes are more challenging but offer more scenic views. The climate on Mount Kilimanjaro varies depending on the altitude. At the base of the mountain, the climate is tropical, with temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). As climbers ascend the mountain, the temperature drops and the climate becomes more arid. At the summit, temperatures can drop to as low as -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit). Mount Kilimanjaro is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa. It is also an important source of water for the surrounding communities, providing water for drinking, irrigation, and hydroelectric power. However, the mountain is also facing environmental challenges, including deforestation, soil erosion, and climate change. Overall, Mount Kilimanjaro is a unique and awe-inspiring natural wonder that attracts visitors from all over the world.",

            "passage": "The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century BC by ancient Chinese states; selective stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor. The Great Wall stretches from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the Ming walls measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi). This is made up of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) sections of actual wall, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers. The Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a popular tourist destination. The wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history. The Great Wall of China has become a symbol of Chinese civilization, representing its ancient history, culture, and strength.",

            "passage": "The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Australia. It stretches over 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles) and covers an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometers (133,000 square miles). The reef is made up of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands, and is home to an incredible diversity of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, 600 species of coral, and numerous other species of plants and animals. The Great Barrier Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the seven natural wonders of the world. It is also an important economic resource for Australia, generating billions of dollars in tourism revenue each year. However, the reef is facing numerous threats, including climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the Great Barrier Reef. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are causing coral bleaching, which occurs when the coral expels the algae that live inside it, turning it white and making it more vulnerable to disease and death. In recent years, the reef has experienced several severe bleaching events, with the most recent occurring in 2020. Pollution is also a major threat to the Great Barrier Reef. Runoff from agriculture, mining, and urban areas can introduce pollutants such as sediment, nutrients, and chemicals into the water, which can harm the coral and other marine life. Overfishing is another concern, as it can disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem and lead to the depletion of certain species. Efforts are being made to protect the Great Barrier Reef, including the implementation of marine parks and protected areas, as well as initiatives to reduce pollution and promote sustainable fishing practices. However, more needs to be done to address the root causes of the threats facing the reef, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to a more sustainable economy.",

The complex covers an area of 72 hectares and consists of 980 buildings, including palaces, halls, pavilions, and courtyards. The Forbidden City was built during the Ming dynasty by Emperor Yongle, who moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing. Construction began in 1406 and was completed in 1420. The palace complex was designed to be the center of the Chinese universe, with the emperor as the Son of Heaven and the ruler of all under heaven. The Forbidden City is surrounded by a moat and a 10-meter-high wall. The main entrance is through the Meridian Gate, which leads to the first courtyard, the largest in the complex. The second courtyard contains the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the largest and most important building in the Forbidden City. It was used for important ceremonies and state occasions, such as the emperor's birthday and the New Year's Day. The third courtyard contains the Hall of Central Harmony, which was used by the emperor to prepare for ceremonies and to rest. The fourth courtyard contains the Hall of Preserving Harmony, which was used for imperial examinations and banquets.

Originally known as the Cappella Magna, the chapel takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV, who restored it between 1477 and 1480. Since that time, the chapel has served as a site for important religious and ceremonial events, including the election of new popes. The Sistine Chapel is perhaps best known for its ceiling, which was painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512. The ceiling depicts scenes from the Book of Genesis, including the creation of Adam and Eve and the story of Noah's Ark. The frescoes are considered some of the greatest works of art in Western civilization, and they have been admired and studied by artists and scholars for centuries. In addition to Michelangelo's ceiling, the Sistine Chapel is also home to a number of other important works of art. The walls of the chapel are decorated with frescoes by a number of Renaissance artists, including Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, and Domenico Ghirlandaio. These frescoes depict scenes from the lives of Moses and Christ, and they are considered some of the finest examples of Renaissance art in existence. The Sistine Chapel is also home to a number of important sculptures, including a statue of Saint Peter by Arnolfo di Cambio and a statue of Saint Paul by Giuseppe Obici. The chapel also contains a number of important relics, including the tombs of several popes and the famous Pieta sculpture by Michelangelo. Today, the Sistine Chapel is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Rome, drawing millions of visitors each year. The chapel is open to the public for most of the year, although it is closed during important religious ceremonies and events. Despite the crowds, visitors to the Sistine Chapel are often struck by the beauty and majesty of the space, and many leave feeling deeply moved by the art and history that surrounds them.",

            "passage": "The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the American city of San Francisco, California – the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula – to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The idea of a bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait was first proposed in the early 19th century. However, it was not until the early 20th century that plans for such a bridge were seriously considered. The project was initially opposed by many, including the military, who feared that the bridge would interfere with ship traffic. However, after years of debate and planning, construction of the bridge began in 1933. The bridge was designed by Joseph Strauss, an engineer who had long dreamed of building a bridge across the Golden Gate. Strauss's design called for a suspension bridge with two main towers, each standing 746 feet (227 meters) tall. The bridge would be supported by two main cables, each made up of thousands of individual wires. The cables would be anchored to massive concrete blocks on either side of the strait. Construction of the bridge was a massive undertaking, involving thousands of workers and costing millions of dollars. The project faced numerous challenges, including strong winds, rough seas, and difficult terrain. However, despite these obstacles, the bridge was completed in just over four years, opening to traffic on May 27, 1937. Since its completion, the Golden Gate Bridge has become one of the most iconic landmarks in the United States. It has been featured in countless films, television shows, and photographs, and has become a symbol of San Francisco and the American West. The bridge is also a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors each year. Despite its fame and popularity, the Golden Gate Bridge has also been the site of numerous suicides. In response, the bridge has implemented a number of suicide prevention measures, including a hotline and a physical barrier designed to deter jumpers. Today, the Golden Gate Bridge remains one of the most impressive engineering feats of the 20th century. It is a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance, and a symbol of the enduring spirit of San Francisco and the United States.",

Designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926), his work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica. Although incomplete, the church is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in November 2010 was consecrated and proclaimed a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Barcelona, with millions of visitors annually. The construction of Sagrada Família began in 1882, and Gaudí became involved in 1883, taking over the project and transforming it with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaudí devoted his last years to the project, and at the time of his death at age 73 in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete. Sagrada Família's construction progressed slowly, as it relied on private donations and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War, only resuming intermittent progress in the 1950s. Construction passed the midpoint in 2010 with some of the project's greatest challenges remaining, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolizing an important Biblical figure in the New Testament. The basilica has a long history of dividing the citizens of Barcelona: over the initial possibility it might compete with Barcelona's cathedral, over Gaudí's design itself, over the possibility that work after Gaudí's death disregarded his design, and the 2007 proposal to build an underground tunnel of Spain's high-speed train directly beneath the basilica's main façade, which could have caused structural damage to the building. Describing Sagrada Família, art critic Rainer Zerbst said \"it is probably impossible to find a church building anything like it in the entire history of art\", and Paul Goldberger describes it as \"the most extraordinary personal interpretation of Gothic architecture since the Middle Ages\".",

At 1,454 feet (443.2 meters) tall, it was the tallest building in the world until the completion of the World Trade Center's North Tower in 1970. It is currently the fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas. The building's construction was part of a competition between Walter Chrysler of the Chrysler Corporation and John Jakob Raskob of General Motors to see who could build the tallest building. The Empire State Building was completed in just over a year, with construction workers completing an average of four and a half floors per week. The building has 102 floors and is made of steel and concrete. It has a total floor area of 2,768,591 square feet (257,211 square meters). The building's exterior is made of Indiana limestone and granite, and it is decorated with Art Deco motifs. The Empire State Building has been a popular tourist attraction since it opened to the public in 1931. Visitors can take an elevator to the 86th floor observation deck, which offers panoramic views of New York City. There is also a smaller observation deck on the 102nd floor. The building has been featured in numerous films and television shows, including King Kong, Sleepless in Seattle, and Friends. It has also been the site of several notable events, including a plane crash in 1945 and a suicide attempt by a woman who jumped from the 86th floor in 1979. In recent years, the Empire State Building has undergone a series of renovations to improve its energy efficiency and reduce its carbon footprint. These renovations include the installation of new windows, the replacement of the building's heating and cooling systems, and the addition of a green roof. Overall, the Empire State Building remains an iconic symbol of New York City and a testament to the ingenuity and determination of its builders.",

It was originally constructed as a small fortress in 889 AD on the remains of Roman fortifications, and was later converted into a royal palace in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid dynasty. The complex is known for its stunning Islamic architecture, intricate tilework, and beautiful gardens. The Alhambra is divided into three main sections: the Alcazaba, the Nasrid Palaces, and the Generalife. The Alcazaba is the oldest part of the complex and served as a military fortress. It features a series of towers and walls that offer stunning views of the surrounding area. The Nasrid Palaces are the most famous part of the Alhambra and are known for their intricate tilework and ornate decoration. The Generalife is a series of gardens and orchards that were used as a summer palace by the Nasrid rulers. The Alhambra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984 and is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Spain. It has inspired countless artists and writers over the centuries, including Washington Irving, who wrote his famous Tales of the Alhambra while living in the complex in the 19th century. Despite its popularity, the Alhambra has faced numerous challenges over the years. It was damaged during the Napoleonic Wars and suffered from neglect in the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, extensive restoration work has been carried out in recent years to preserve the complex for future generations. Today, visitors to the Alhambra can explore the various sections of the complex and marvel at its stunning architecture and decoration. The complex is open to the public year-round, although tickets must be purchased in advance due to its popularity.",

            "passage": "The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century BC by ancient Chinese states; selective stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor. The Great Wall stretches from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the Ming walls measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi). This is made up of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) sections of actual wall, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers. The Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a popular tourist destination. The wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history. The Great Wall of China has become a symbol of Chinese civilization, and its history and cultural significance attract millions of visitors every year.",

Fifteen of the world's 25 largest hotels by room count are on the Strip, with a total of over 62,000 rooms. One of the most iconic landmarks on the Strip is the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign, located at the southern end of the Strip near the airport.

The hotel was later destroyed by a fire in 1960. The first high-rise hotel on the Strip was the Riviera, which opened in 1955. The Riviera was demolished in 2016 to make way for a convention center expansion. Other notable hotels on the Strip include the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, the Venetian, the Wynn, and the MGM Grand.

Eiffel's company specialized in designing and constructing metal structures, including bridges, viaducts, and railway stations. He was known for his innovative use of iron and steel, which allowed him to create structures that were both strong and lightweight. In 1884, Eiffel was approached by the French government to design a monument for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris. He proposed a 300-meter-tall tower made of iron, which would be the tallest structure in the world at the time. Despite initial opposition from some members of the public and the artistic community, the tower was eventually built and became an instant icon of Paris. Eiffel continued to work on a variety of projects throughout his career, including the Garabit viaduct in France and the Statue of Liberty in New York. He was also involved in the construction of several bridges and railway stations in South America and Asia. Eiffel was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and received numerous awards and honors for his work. He died in Paris in 1923 at the age of 91. Today, the Eiffel Tower remains one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world and a testament to Eiffel's engineering genius.",

It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The population of Australia is approximately 26 million people, making it the world's 52nd most populous country. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century, who named it New Holland. In 1770, James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for Great Britain, and the British established a penal colony in New South Wales in 1788. The population grew steadily in the following years, and by the 1850s, Australia was experiencing a gold rush, which led to the establishment of several new cities. Australia is a highly developed country with a strong economy and a high standard of living. It is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific Islands Forum. Australia is also known for its unique flora and fauna, including kangaroos, koalas, and the Great Barrier Reef. Australia is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government. The Queen of Australia, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is also the monarch of 15 other Commonwealth realms. The Australian government is divided into three branches: the executive branch, headed by the Prime Minister; the legislative branch, consisting of the bicameral Parliament; and the judicial branch, headed by the High Court of Australia. Australia is a multicultural society, with a diverse population that includes people of European, Asian, and Indigenous backgrounds. English is the official language, but many other languages are also spoken, reflecting the country's diverse cultural heritage.

Arizona is known for its desert climate, exceptionally hot summers, and mild winters, but it also features pine forests and mountain ranges in the northern high country, with much cooler weather than the lower deserts. The state's name appears to originate from an earlier Spanish name, Arizonac, derived from the O'odham name alĭ ṣonak, meaning \"small spring\", which initially applied only to an area near the silver mining camp of Planchas de Plata, Sonora. To the European settlers, their pronunciation sounded like \"Arissona\". The area is still known as alĭ ṣonak in the O'odham language. Another possible origin is the Basque phrase haritz ona (\"the good oak\"), as there were numerous Basque sheepherders in the area.",

In 1911, Bingham led an expedition to the Andes Mountains in search of the lost city of Vilcabamba, the last refuge of the Inca Empire. Instead, he stumbled upon Machu Picchu, which had been abandoned for centuries. Bingham's discovery of Machu Picchu brought international attention to the site and helped to establish the importance of Inca civilization.

The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. The following year, Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt, ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus, effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. The imperial successor to the Republic endured for some 500 years.",

In 1521, the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the territory from its base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain. Three centuries later, Mexico achieved independence from Spain in 1821. The post-independence period was characterized by economic instability, territorial secession, and civil war, including foreign intervention, two empires, and two long domestic dictatorships.

It is the largest ballcourt in Mesoamerica, measuring 168 meters long and 70 meters wide. The court was built by the Maya civilization between 900 and 1100 AD and was used for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame, a sport that was played throughout the region for over 3,000 years. The ballgame was a ritualistic event that had religious and political significance, and it was often played as a way to resolve conflicts between different groups. The Great Ball Court is known for its unique architecture, which includes two large stone rings that are set high on the walls of the court. The rings are believed to have been used as goals for the ballgame, and players would have had to hit the ball through them in order to score points. The court also features a series of carved stone panels that depict scenes from the ballgame, as well as other important events in Maya history. Today, the Great Ball Court is a popular tourist attraction and is considered one of the most impressive examples of ancient Mesoamerican architecture.",

Despite this, he was respected by his crew and was able to maintain their loyalty through his leadership and charisma. In 1683, Cowley was captured by the Spanish and imprisoned in Cartagena. He was eventually released and returned to piracy, but his luck began to run out. In 1686, he was captured by the Royal Navy and brought back to England, where he was tried and executed for piracy. Despite his brutal reputation, Cowley remains a popular figure in pirate lore. He is often portrayed as a swashbuckling hero who fought against the tyranny of the Spanish Empire.

Born in Guangzhou and raised in Hong Kong and Shanghai, Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the gardens at Suzhou. In 1935, he moved to the United States and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania's architecture school, but quickly transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was unhappy with the focus at both schools on Beaux-Arts architecture, and spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially Le Corbusier. After graduating, he joined the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) and became a friend of the Bauhaus architects Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. In 1948, Pei was recruited by New York City real estate magnate William Zeckendorf, for whom he worked for seven years before establishing his own independent design firm, I. M. Pei & Associates, in 1955. Among the most notable projects he designed during his early career were the Luce Memorial Chapel at Tunghai University in Taiwan (1963), the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado (1967), and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston (1979). Pei's later work included the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar (2008), and the Macao Science Center in Macau (2009).

Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by area. The country is officially divided into 23 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. China emerged as one of the world's earliest civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-legendary Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty, which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa. The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. In the late 19th century, the Qing dynasty was overthrown following the Boxer Rebellion, which was itself crushed by an international alliance led by the Eight-Nation Alliance. The establishment of the Republic of China in 1912 led to the Chinese Civil War and the division of China into the two political entities of the PRC and the ROC. The PRC is a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of China, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. The PRC also claims Taiwan – which is controlled by the ROC – as its 23rd province, a claim controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan and the unresolved Chinese Civil War.",

His artistic versatility was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Italian Leonardo da Vinci. Several scholars have described Michelangelo as the greatest artist of his age and even as the greatest artist of all time. A number of his works in painting, sculpture, and architecture rank among the most famous in existence. His output in every field during his long life was prodigious; when the sheer volume of correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences that survive is also taken into account, he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century. Two of his best-known works, the Pietà and David, were sculpted before he turned thirty. Despite holding a low opinion of painting, he also created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture. At the age of 74, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. He transformed the plan so that the western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, with some modification, after his death. Michelangelo was unique as the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive. In fact, two biographies were published during his lifetime. One of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that he was the pinnacle of all artistic achievement since the beginning of the Renaissance, a viewpoint that continued to have currency in art history for centuries. In his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino (\"the divine one\"). His contemporaries often admired his terribilità—his ability to instil a sense of awe. Attempts by subsequent artists to imitate Michelangelo's impassioned, highly personal style resulted in Mannerism, the next major movement in Western art after the High Renaissance.",

His most famous work is the fresco cycle in the Tornabuoni Chapel of the Santa Maria Novella church, which depicts scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary and the life of St. John the Baptist. Ghirlandaio was also a skilled portrait painter and was commissioned to paint portraits of many prominent Florentine citizens, including members of the Medici family. His portraits are known for their realism and attention to detail. In addition to his painting, Ghirlandaio was also a successful businessman and ran a large workshop that employed many assistants.

Gaudí's work was influenced by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. He considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as trencadís, made of waste ceramic pieces. Under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, Gaudí became part of the Modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream Modernisme, culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms. Gaudí rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and molding the details as he conceived them.",

The Alhambra features a series of interconnected palaces, courtyards, and gardens, all surrounded by high walls and towers. Other notable examples of Alcazabas in Spain include the Alcazaba of Malaga, the Alcazaba of Almeria, and the Alcazaba of Antequera. These structures were built during the same period as the Alhambra and feature similar architectural styles and design elements. Today, many of these Alcazabas have been restored and are open to the public as museums or tourist attractions.

Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81–96). These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius). The Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine. Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit \"Way of the Cross\" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.",
