The tower is the tallest structure in Paris, and was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930.",

Built of concrete and sand, it is the largest amphitheatre in the world, and is considered one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and engineering. It was used for a variety of events, including gladiator contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, and executions. The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. It was commissioned around 70–75 AD by Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty and completed in 80 AD under his son, Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Titus's brother, Domitian. These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name. The Colosseum could hold up to 80,000 spectators, and was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, and dramas based on mythology or historical events. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, and a fortress. Although in the 21st century it stays partially ruined because of damage caused by time and earthquakes, the Colosseum is an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and one of the most popular tourist attractions in Rome. It is also an important archaeological site, providing insights into Roman engineering and construction techniques as well as the culture and society of ancient Rome.",

The copper statue, designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, was a gift to the United States from the people of France. It is of a robed female figure representing the Roman goddess Libertas, who bears a torch and a tabula ansata (a tablet evoking the law) upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States, and is a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad. Bartholdi was inspired by French republicanism and the Enlightenment, as well as the end of slavery in France and the United States. He intended to depict a woman with a strong, athletic body and a crown of stars representing the concept of liberty. The statue's torch was originally supposed to be lit by the sun's rays, but a lack of funding led Bartholdi to use electricity instead. The statue was built in France starting in 1875, and then disassembled and shipped to the United States in 1885. It was reassembled on its pedestal in New York Harbor in 1886. The statue has been a symbol of freedom and democracy ever since its dedication in 1886. It has also been a symbol of hope for immigrants arriving in the United States, as well as a symbol of American patriotism. The statue has been featured in works of art and literature, and has been referenced in popular culture.",

President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the Grand Canyon area, and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery. The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide, and over a mile (6,000 feet or 1,800 meters) deep. The canyon was formed by the Colorado River, which began eroding the rock of the Colorado Plateau through geologic uplift and tectonic activity about 70 million years ago. The river also helped create the distinctive layered bands of rock that reveal millions of years of geologic history. The Grand Canyon is home to numerous plant and animal species, including several that are found nowhere else in the world. The canyon's climate and geology have created a variety of habitats, including desert, forest, and even a tropical rainforest. The Colorado River and its tributaries support a diverse fish population, including the endangered humpback chub. The Grand Canyon is a popular tourist destination, drawing millions of visitors each year.

It is one of the most famous and iconic archaeological sites in the world, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Petra was originally inhabited by the Nabataean people, who were a nomadic Arab tribe that settled in the area around the 6th century BC. They established a trading center in the area, which became a major crossroads for the silk, spice, and incense trade routes that linked China, India, and the Mediterranean. The Nabataeans were known for their ability to control the water supply in the area, and they built a complex system of dams, cisterns, and aqueducts to collect and store water. The Nabataean civilization declined in the 3rd century AD, and Petra was gradually abandoned. It was not until the 19th century that the site was rediscovered by the Swiss explorer Johann Burckhardt, who made the journey to Petra disguised as an Arab. Since then, Petra has become a major tourist attraction, and is visited by millions of people each year. The site of Petra is spread over a large area, and includes numerous tombs, temples, and other structures that were carved into the sandstone cliffs by the Nabataean people. The most famous structure in Petra is the Treasury, a large building that was carved into the cliff face and is decorated with intricate carvings and frescoes.

It is situated on a mountain ridge above the Sacred Valley which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco and through which the Urubamba River flows. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with walls of cut stone fit together so precisely that a knife blade cannot fit between them. The complex consists of more than 150 buildings, from houses to temples, storage rooms, and public spaces. The central square, which measures 135 meters (443 ft) long and 75 meters (246 ft) wide, is surrounded by buildings with carved stone walls and trapezoidal windows. The most notable building is the Intihuatana, a stone that serves as a sundial and was used by the Inca to mark the solstices. Machu Picchu was probably built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1471). It is believed to have been built in the early 15th century, and was abandoned when the Spanish conquerors arrived in the 16th century.

This spectacular light show is caused by the collision of charged particles from the sun with atoms in the Earth's atmosphere. The Aurora Borealis is most commonly seen in countries such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Canada, but can also be seen in other parts of the world under certain conditions. The Aurora Borealis typically appears as a greenish glow in the night sky, but can also appear in shades of pink, purple, and blue. The colors are caused by different types of atoms in the Earth's atmosphere being excited by the charged particles from the sun. The Aurora Borealis is most active during periods of high solar activity, such as during solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The Aurora Borealis has been a source of fascination and inspiration for people for centuries. It has been depicted in art and literature, and has even been used as a symbol of national pride in some countries. In addition to its aesthetic appeal, the Aurora Borealis has also been studied by scientists for its potential impact on technology and communication systems. Despite its beauty and scientific significance, the Aurora Borealis is a fragile phenomenon that is vulnerable to changes in the Earth's environment. Climate change and other human activities can affect the Earth's atmosphere and disrupt the natural balance that creates the Aurora Borealis.

This spectacular light show is caused by the collision of charged particles from the sun with atoms in the Earth's atmosphere. The colors of the Northern Lights depend on the type of atom that is being struck, with green being the most common color. The Northern Lights can be seen in countries such as Norway, Sweden, and Canada, where the weather conditions are often cold and clear. The Northern Lights have been a source of fascination for people for centuries, and they continue to inspire awe and wonder in those who witness them.",
