His voyages initiated the Spanish colonization of the Americas and the transatlantic slave trade. Columbus's early life is somewhat unclear, but he was born in the Republic of Genoa, in modern-day Italy, to a family of wool weavers. He worked as a seaman and later became a merchant, sailing along the coasts of Europe and Africa. In 1485, he married Felipa Moniz, the daughter of a wool merchant from the port of Lisbon, Portugal. In 1492, Columbus received royal support from Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, who provided him with three ships and a crew of 90 men for his first voyage. He departed from Palos, Spain, on August 3, 1492, and sailed westward across the Atlantic Ocean. After a month-long voyage, he landed on the island of San Salvador in the Bahamas on October 12, 1492, which he claimed for Spain. Columbus went on to make three more voyages to the Americas, each time sailing farther south along the coast of Central and South America. He explored the Orinoco River in Venezuela and the Amazon River in Brazil, and he believed he had reached the East Indies.",
