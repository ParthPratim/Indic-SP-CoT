            "passage": "World War I (WWI), also known as the First World War, was a global war that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. It involved the majority of the world's nations, organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies (centred around the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom, France and Russia) and the Central Powers (originally led by the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire). The war was sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo in 1914, and it quickly escalated into a full-scale conflict. The war saw major technological advances in military affairs, including the first use of poison gas in combat and the development of tanks and aircraft. It also resulted in the deaths of more than 8 million soldiers and an estimated 6 million civilians. The war ended with the defeat of the Central Powers and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, which established the League of Nations and imposed heavy reparations on Germany. The war had a profound impact on society and culture, both in Europe and around the world. It contributed to the rise of nationalism and the decline of empires, and it paved the way for the emergence of new political ideologies such as communism and fascism. The war also had a significant impact on literature and the arts, with many writers and artists using their work to express their feelings about the conflict. In the years since the war, it has been studied and analyzed by historians and scholars, who have sought to understand its causes and consequences.",

The vast majority of the world's countries, including all the great powers, organized themselves into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. The Allies were led by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, while the Axis were led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. The war was the deadliest in history, with an estimated 70 to 85 million people killed, which was about 3% of the world population at the time. The war began on September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France responded by declaring war on Germany, but they did not provide significant assistance to Poland. The Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east on September 17, 1939, and the country was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union. The United States remained neutral at first, but in 1941, it entered the war after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The war was fought on multiple fronts, including Europe, Asia, and Africa. In Europe, the Allies fought a successful campaign in North Africa and Italy before invading France in 1944. The Soviet Union fought a long and brutal war on the Eastern Front against Germany, which ultimately resulted in the defeat of Germany and the capture of Berlin by the Soviet Union in 1945. In Asia, Japan conquered much of China and Southeast Asia before being defeated by the Allies in a series of battles, including the Battle of Midway and the Battle of Okinawa.

The war was fought between the communist North Vietnam, supported by its communist allies in the region, and the government of South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other anti-communist countries. The war began in 1955, following the end of the First Indochina War and the Geneva Conference, which temporarily divided Vietnam into a communist-led north and a US-supported south. The war ended with the fall of Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, to the North Vietnamese Army in 1975. The war was characterized by guerrilla warfare and a protracted conflict that involved the use of air power, ground forces, and special operations. The US government viewed the war as a way to prevent the spread of communism and to contain the influence of the Soviet Union and China in Southeast Asia. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, on the other hand, saw the war as a struggle for national liberation and unification. The war had a significant impact on the social, political, and economic landscape of Vietnam, as well as on the wider world. It resulted in the deaths of millions of people, including both military personnel and civilians, and led to the displacement of millions more. The war also had a profound impact on the US military, leading to a reevaluation of its strategic goals and tactics.
