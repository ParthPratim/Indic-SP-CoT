            "passage": "Jimmy Darmody was a fictional character in the HBO television series Boardwalk Empire, portrayed by actor Michael Pitt. He was a protégé of the show's main character, Enoch \"Nucky\" Thompson, and a central figure in the series' first season. Darmody was born in 1899 in New York City to an Irish-American family. He served in World War I and returned to the United States with a Purple Heart. After the war, he became involved in organized crime, working for Nucky Thompson as a bootlegger and enforcer. Darmody was a complex character, torn between his loyalty to Nucky and his desire for independence. He was also haunted by his experiences in the war, which led him to have a violent temper and a tendency to act impulsively. Throughout the first season, Darmody's relationship with Nucky became increasingly strained. He became involved with Nucky's mistress, Billie Kent, and was eventually betrayed by Nucky, who had him killed in a hit ordered by rival gangster Gyp Rossetti. Darmody's death was a major turning point in the series, leading to a power struggle between Nucky and his rivals. His character was widely praised by critics and audiences, with many citing Michael Pitt's performance as a highlight of the show's first season.",
