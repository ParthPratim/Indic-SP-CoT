            "passage": "Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American novelist, short-story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated style—which he termed the \"iceberg theory\"—had a profound influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous life and public image as a macho \"man's man\" endeared him to millions. Born in Oak Park, Illinois, in 1899, Hemingway was the second of six children. His father was a physician, and his mother was a musician. Hemingway was a high school athlete and a devotee of boxing, and he began writing for his high school newspaper. After graduation, he worked as a reporter for several newspapers before joining the Red Cross during World War I. He was seriously injured in 1918 when he was hit by a mortar shell, and he was awarded the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery for rescuing an injured soldier under fire. After the war, Hemingway moved to Paris, where he became part of the expatriate community that included Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ezra Pound. He published his first novel, The Sun Also Rises, in 1926, and it established him as a leading voice of the \"Lost Generation\" of disillusioned young people who came of age during World War I. The novel is a bleak portrait of a group of expatriates who drift aimlessly through life, unable to find meaning or purpose. Hemingway's subsequent novels, including A Farewell to Arms (1929) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), explored similar themes of disillusionment, loss, and the futility of war.",

            "passage": "William Shakespeare (baptised 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\". His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, the authorship of some of which is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children. He began his career in theatre as an actor, later writing and producing his own plays and forming a company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he retired to Stratford and died there three years later. Shakespeare's writing shows a deep understanding of human nature and a mastery of the English language. His plays are known for their complex characters, intricate plots, and vivid imagery, and have been interpreted in various ways over the centuries. They have been adapted to film, television, and stage, and have influenced literature and culture around the world. Shakespeare's works continue to be studied, performed, and enjoyed today, and his legacy remains a significant part of English and world literature.",

Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage for social standing and economic security, and her works are noted for their realism and biting social commentary. Austen's novels have been adapted for film and television numerous times, and her name and image have been used for brand marketing and merchandise. Her works have also been adapted for stage, and her influence on English literature and popular culture is profound. Austen's life is not well documented, and much of what is known about her comes from her letters. She was born in Steventon, Hampshire, where her father was rector. Austen lived most of her life as part of a close-knit family with her parents, sister, and brothers. She was educated at home by her father and her brothers, and she wrote her first novel, Sense and Sensibility, when she was in her mid-twenties. Austen's novels are set in the English countryside and feature a cast of characters who are primarily members of the landed gentry. Her works often explore the social norms and expectations of the time, and the ways in which they can constrain and limit the lives of women. Austen's novels are also known for their wit and humor, and for their ability to capture the nuances of human relationships. Austen's novels have been praised for their realism and their ability to capture the social and cultural context of the time.",

Dostoevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the context of the troubled political, social, and spiritual context of 19th-century Russia. He is best known for his novels Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, and The Brothers Karamazov. Dostoevsky was born in Moscow in 1821, the second of seven children. His father was a former army doctor who had taken up a post as a physician in the military hospital in Moscow. His mother was the daughter of a retired army captain. Dostoevsky was educated at home by his father, who was a firm disciplinarian. He later attended the Moscow Academy of Military Engineers, where he studied engineering and mathematics. In 1849, Dostoevsky was arrested and sentenced to death for his involvement in the Petrashevsky Circle, a group of intellectuals who were critical of the Tsarist government. He was led to the execution site, but at the last moment his sentence was commuted to four years of hard labor in a Siberian prison camp. It was during his time in prison that Dostoevsky began to formulate his philosophical ideas, which would later be expressed in his novels. After his release from prison in 1854, Dostoevsky began to write fiction. His early works were influenced by the ideas of the utopian socialists, who believed that a new social order could be created through reason and human brotherhood.",

She was born in London to a well-connected family and was educated by private tutors before attending the University of London. Woolf's writing often focused on the inner lives of women and the role of women in society. She was a founding member of the Bloomsbury Group, a collective of artists and intellectuals who were known for their progressive ideas and unconventional lifestyles. Woolf's most famous works include \"Mrs. Dalloway\" (1925), \"To the Lighthouse\" (1927), and \"Orlando\" (1928). These novels are known for their experimental style and their exploration of themes such as memory, time, and identity. Woolf was also a prolific essayist and wrote extensively on topics such as feminism, literature, and mental health. In addition to her writing, Woolf was a prominent figure in the feminist movement of the early 20th century. She was a vocal advocate for women's rights and argued that women needed to be given greater opportunities to express themselves through literature and art. Woolf was also a suffragist and worked tirelessly to promote women's suffrage in the UK. Despite her many accomplishments, Woolf struggled with mental illness throughout her life. She was diagnosed with depression and had several breakdowns, which she wrote about in her diaries and essays. In 1941, Woolf drowned herself in the River Ouse, near her home in Sussex.",
