The movement is in sonata form, with a development section that includes a fugato section.

            "passage": "Schubert's \"Ave Maria\" is a popular and much-recorded setting of the Latin text \"Ave Maria\" for soprano voice and piano, composed by Franz Schubert in 1825 as part of his Op. 52 song cycle \"Winterreise\". The song's melody has been used as a basis for many variations and arrangements, and it has been recorded by numerous singers and instrumentalists. The song's lyrics are a prayer to the Virgin Mary, asking for her intercession and protection. The melody is simple and beautiful, with a haunting quality that has made it a favorite of audiences and performers alike. The song is often performed in a slow and contemplative manner, with the singer using expressive phrasing and dynamic contrasts to convey the emotional depth of the text. The song has been arranged for a wide variety of instruments and ensembles, including orchestra, guitar, and harp. It has also been used in many films and television shows, and has become a staple of classical music concerts and recitals. Despite its popularity, \"Ave Maria\" has been the subject of controversy and debate. Some critics have argued that Schubert's setting is not truly a setting of the \"Ave Maria\" prayer, as it omits some of the traditional text and adds new words of Schubert's own. Others have objected to the song's use in secular contexts, arguing that it is a sacred text that should be treated with respect and not used for commercial or entertainment purposes.",

The concertos are known for their vivid and evocative descriptions of the natural world, with each concerto depicting the sights and sounds of its respective season. For example, in the \"Winter\" concerto, the solo violin imitates the sound of a barking dog, while in the \"Summer\" concerto, the solo violin imitates the sound of a bird singing.
