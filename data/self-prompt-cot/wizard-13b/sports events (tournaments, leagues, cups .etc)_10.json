The tournament has been held every four years since the first edition in 1930, except for the years of the Second World War, with the exception of the 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were held as a single tournament contested by national teams in South America. The tournament consists of several stages, including qualification, which takes place over the preceding three years, and the final tournament, which is held over a month in the host nation(s). The qualification process, which is conducted by the respective continental confederations, determines the participating teams, with the number of places allocated to each continent being based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams. The final tournament, which is held every four years, consists of several stages, including the group stage, knockout stage, and the final. The group stage, which is held in multiple venues across the host nation(s), involves the 32 teams being divided into eight groups of four teams each. Each team plays the other three teams in their group once, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the knockout stage. The knockout stage, which is held in multiple venues across the host nation(s), involves the remaining 16 teams being drawn into four sets of single-elimination matches. The winners of each match advance to the next round, with the final two teams playing the championship match to determine the winner of the tournament. The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, and the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games.",

The competition format is similar to that of the Presidents Cup, which is contested between teams from the rest of the world and the United States. Each team consists of 12 players, and the competition is played over three days. On the first two days, there are four matches played in a foursomes format, where two players from each team play together as a pair.
