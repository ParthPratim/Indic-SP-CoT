There are over 25,000 known species of orchids, making them one of the largest families of flowering plants. They are classified into eight different subfamilies, based on their morphology and evolutionary history. Orchids have evolved a wide range of adaptations to help them survive and thrive in their various habitats. Some species have developed specialized pollination mechanisms, such as traps that mimic the appearance and scent of female insects, in order to attract male pollinators. Others have developed symbiotic relationships with fungi, which help them to absorb nutrients from the soil. Orchids are also known for their complex and beautiful blooms, which can range in size from tiny, delicate flowers to large, showy displays. Many species have evolved intricate patterns and colors on their petals, which are thought to help them attract pollinators. Despite their beauty and popularity, many orchid species are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection for the horticultural trade.

Ivies are popular as ornamental plants, and some species are used in traditional medicine. Ivies are characterized by their tendrils, which are modified leaves that allow them to climb up trees and other structures. They have large, glossy leaves that are often variegated, and small greenish-white flowers that are borne in clusters. The fruit is a small black berry that is poisonous to humans and many animals. Ivies are hardy plants that can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and soil conditions. They are often used as ground covers, and can also be trained to climb up walls, trellises, and other structures. Some species, such as English ivy (Hedera helix), are commonly used as houseplants. Ivies have a long history of use in traditional medicine. In China, for example, the roots of some species are used to treat fever, cough, and other respiratory ailments. In Europe, ivy has been used to treat skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis. Despite their many uses, ivies can be invasive in some areas, particularly in regions where the climate is mild and rainfall is abundant. They can quickly overtake native plant species and disrupt local ecosystems. For this reason, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact of planting ivies before doing so.",
