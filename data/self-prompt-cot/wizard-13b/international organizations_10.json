Its main functions include providing a framework for negotiating and enforcing trade agreements, resolving trade disputes, and reviewing and harmonizing trade policies. The WTO is also responsible for the administration of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which is the legal foundation of the organization. The WTO has 164 member states as of 2021, representing more than 98% of global trade. The organization was established on January 1, 1995, and is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The WTO's member states negotiate and set rules for international trade through a series of agreements, known as the WTO agreements. These agreements cover a wide range of issues, including trade in goods and services, intellectual property rights, and trade-related aspects of investment. The WTO also provides a forum for member states to negotiate and settle trade disputes, and it monitors national trade policies for compliance with WTO agreements. The organization's decisions are made by the Ministerial Conference, which is composed of representatives from all member states, and by the General Council, which is composed of representatives from each member state. The WTO is widely regarded as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1947. The GATT was designed to promote free trade by reducing tariffs and other trade barriers, and it was the foundation of the post-war international economic system. The WTO was established in 1995 as a successor to the GATT, with the aim of creating a more effective and transparent system for regulating international trade.",

The ILO was established in 1919 as an agency of the League of Nations under the Treaty of Versailles. The organization's initial focus was to address the social and economic consequences of World War I, but its mandate was quickly expanded to cover all aspects of labor relations and workers' rights. After the demise of the League of Nations, the ILO became one of the 11 specialized agencies of the United Nations in 1946. The ILO's primary role is to formulate international labor standards in the form of conventions and recommendations that set minimum standards of basic labor rights. These standards are negotiated and adopted by governments, employers, and workers from member states. The ILO also provides technical assistance to member states to help them improve their labor practices and social protection systems. The ILO's work is guided by the principles of social justice and decent work for all. The organization seeks to promote social and economic development by improving working conditions, promoting social protection, and increasing opportunities for decent and productive work for all. The ILO also works to eliminate child labor and forced labor, and to promote gender equality in the workplace. The ILO has a unique tripartite structure, with representatives from governments, employers, and workers from member states. This structure ensures that the organization's decisions are made through a democratic and consultative process that takes into account the interests of all stakeholders.",

The Fund's mandate was updated in 2012 to include focus on financial sector issues and to help member countries strengthen their capacity for financial oversight and regulation. The IMF provides policy advice and financial assistance to member countries to help them achieve macroeconomic stability and reduce poverty.
