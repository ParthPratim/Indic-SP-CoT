Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained a shareholder, while Jobs resigned to found NeXT.",

He was born on January 15, 1930, in Montgomery, Alabama, and grew up in a family that was deeply involved in the struggle for civil rights. Johnson's father was a Baptist minister, and his mother was a schoolteacher. Johnson attended segregated public schools in Montgomery, where he was an excellent student and a standout athlete. He went on to attend the historically black Tuskegee Institute, where he studied mechanical engineering. After graduating in 1952, Johnson worked as a teacher and a coach in rural Alabama. In 1955, Johnson became involved in the civil rights movement when he was recruited by the Montgomery Improvement Association to serve as a leader in the bus boycott. He played a key role in organizing the boycott, which lasted for over a year and ultimately led to the desegregation of Montgomery's public transportation system. Johnson's leadership in the bus boycott made him a national figure, and he went on to become a prominent leader in the civil rights movement. He worked closely with Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders, and played a key role in organizing the March on Washington in 1963. Johnson was also a key figure in the Selma to Montgomery marches, which were a series of protests that took place in 1965. The marches were organized to demand voting rights for African Americans, and they were met with violent resistance from state and local authorities.",

It is the code that is being actively developed and modified by the project's developers. The term \"upstream\" is used to distinguish it from \"downstream\" code, which refers to the version of the software that has been released and is being used by end-users. Upstream development is typically done by a project's core developers, who are responsible for adding new features, fixing bugs, and improving the overall quality of the software. The upstream code is often shared with the wider community of developers who are contributing to the project, either through a version control system like Git or through a code hosting platform like GitHub. Upstream development is an important part of the open-source software ecosystem, as it allows developers to collaborate and share their work with others. It also allows end-users to benefit from the latest features and improvements to the software, as they are incorporated into the downstream code. However, upstream development can also be challenging, as it requires a high degree of coordination and communication between developers, as well as a willingness to accept and incorporate feedback from others.",
