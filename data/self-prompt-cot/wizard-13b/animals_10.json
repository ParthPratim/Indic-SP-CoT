They are known for their distinctive mane, which is made up of long hairs on the neck, head, and shoulders of male lions. Female lions, called lionesses, are smaller and less muscular than males. Lions are apex predators and are capable of taking down large prey such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. They are also known to scavenge on carrion and will eat smaller prey such as birds, rodents, and reptiles.

The Damalis species is the palmate-leafed palm-viper, which is a venomous snake that feeds on giraffes. The Hylogerius species is the hyloger, which is a prehistoric relative of giraffes. Giraffes are known for their long necks and legs, which help them reach high branches and browse on leaves that other herbivores cannot reach. They have a distinctive coat pattern that is unique to each individual, and their tongues are long and prehensile, which they use to grasp leaves and twigs. Giraffes are social animals that live in loose groups called towers or herds, which are led by a dominant male. They communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions.

Male gorillas are significantly larger than females and can weigh up to 400 pounds (180 kg). Gorillas are primarily vegetarians, feeding on a variety of plants, including leaves, stems, and fruits. They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from tough plant material. Gorillas are also known to eat insects and occasionally small animals. Gorillas are highly social animals that live in groups called troops. Troops are typically led by a dominant male, known as a silverback, who is responsible for protecting the group and mating with the females. Females in the group typically give birth to one baby at a time, after a gestation period of approximately 8.5 months. Infants are completely dependent on their mothers for the first few years of life and learn important social and survival skills from the other members of the troop. Gorillas are critically endangered, with only about 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild. Their habitat is being destroyed by deforestation and human activities such as mining and agriculture.

It covers 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area and comprises 30% of its land area. With approximately 4.5 billion people, it hosts 60% of the world's current human population. In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, on the west by the Red Sea and Europe, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical or geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in Ancient Greece. The history of Asia can be traced back to the earliest human migrations, with the first modern humans likely to have emerged in Africa and then spread to Asia around 60,000 years ago. The continent has since been home to many of the world's oldest civilizations, including those of Mesopotamia, India, China, and Japan. Asia has a diverse range of climates and landscapes, ranging from the dry deserts of the Middle East to the tropical forests in Southeast Asia and the tropical rainforests in South Asia. It is also home to the world's highest mountain range, the Himalayas, and the world's largest river, the Yangtze.

Grevy's zebra has a distinctive coat pattern, with narrow black stripes on a white background. The stripes are narrower and more closely spaced than those of other zebra species, and they extend down the legs and across the face. The head and neck are also black, and the ears are large and rounded. Grevy's zebra is a social animal, and it lives in small harems consisting of a stallion and several mares and their foals. The stallion defends the harem from other males, and he mates with the females. Grevy's zebra is also known for its distinctive vocalizations, which include grunts, snorts, and whinnies. The population of Grevy's zebra has declined dramatically in recent years, due to habitat loss, hunting, and competition with domestic livestock. It is now considered endangered, and conservation efforts are underway to protect the remaining populations.
