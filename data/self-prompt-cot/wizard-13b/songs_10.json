            "passage": "\"Wonderwall\" is a song by the English rock band Oasis, written by the band's guitarist and primary songwriter Noel Gallagher. The song was released as the second single from their debut album, Definitely Maybe, in 1995. It is considered one of the band's signature songs and a defining moment of the Britpop genre. The song's title is a reference to the 1968 film Blowup, in which the character played by David Hemmings repeatedly says the phrase \"Wonderwall\" to himself. The lyrics of the song are a mix of personal reflection and social commentary, with Gallagher singing about his feelings of isolation and disconnection from the world around him. The chorus of the song features the line \"You're my wonderwall / You're my wonderwall\", which has been interpreted as a declaration of love or a statement of admiration for someone who provides a sense of comfort and security. Musically, \"Wonderwall\" is characterized by its simple yet effective melody and the use of a tambourine to create a shimmering, dreamy effect. The song's distinctive guitar riff, played by Gallagher on an acoustic guitar, has been praised for its catchy simplicity and its ability to stick in the listener's head. The song's bridge features a harmonica solo played by former Rolling Stone Mick Gallagher, Noel's brother. \"Wonderwall\" was a commercial success for Oasis, reaching the top 10 in the UK and Ireland and becoming the band's first top 40 hit in the US. It has since been covered by numerous artists and has become a staple of classic rock radio.",

It is a type of musical drama that is performed in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra and a cast of singers. Opera is characterized by its use of elaborate costumes, scenery, and stage effects, as well as its use of complex musical forms and vocal techniques. Opera is typically performed in a large theater, with the audience seated in a specific area called the \"house.\" The stage is divided into two parts: the \"proscenium\" and the \"apron.\" The proscenium is the area in front of the curtain, where most of the action takes place. The apron is the area in front of the proscenium, where some of the action takes place. Opera is typically performed in a language other than the one spoken by the audience, such as Italian, French, or German. This is because opera was originally intended for the aristocracy, who were expected to be familiar with these languages. However, many operas have been translated into other languages, making them more accessible to a wider audience. Opera is divided into several different forms, including opera seria, opera buffa, and opera semiseria. Opera seria is a serious form of opera that typically features a tragic ending. Opera buffa is a comedic form of opera that is often used to provide comic relief. Opera semiseria is a form of opera that combines elements of both opera seria and opera buffa. Opera has had a significant impact on the world of music and culture. It has inspired countless composers and musicians, and has been a source of inspiration for artists in other fields, such as literature and film.",

Oasis achieved worldwide success with their debut album, Definitely Maybe (1994), and followed it up with two more highly acclaimed albums, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?

Despite their turbulent history, Oasis remains one of the most successful and influential bands of the 1990s.
