His empire spread to much of the world, and his conquests helped shape its modern borders. He is credited with unifying the Greek world and initiating a trend of Hellenistic rule, which continued in various forms until the Roman Empire's fall in 476 CE. In his later years, he focused more on administration and politics. The most famous of his accomplishments was the creation of the city of Alexandria, Egypt, by order of Ptolemy II. The city served as an important centre for scientific knowledge and intellectual pursuits. After his death in 323 BCE, he was buried at his native Macedonia. Alexander's life and his influence over two empires was the subject of a controversial biographical novel by George S. Clore, Alexander the Great. In 1974, the BBC produced a television series which followed his life.",

How is it that his Federalist papers are regarded as \"important works\"? I am still not sure. It seems to me that if the government is only supposed to provide the Constitution and is supposed to be limited to only three branches, and is supposed to be limited to the separation of powers, how does a Federalist become Federalist and vice versa?
