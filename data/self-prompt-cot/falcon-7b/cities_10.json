Construction began in 1930, a year after the Wall Street Crash in 1929, which resulted in the collapse of many banks and businesses. The Empire State Building's height was not an especially unusual feature during this period, as it was only about half a foot taller than the other skyscrapers at the time. The building is characterized by a bronze eagle statue atop its pinnacle. The eagle's head, wings and feet are depicted in relief, which are gilded in copper with a gold lustre and standing atop an oval plaque with the inscription \"This is a land of opportunity\". The building's main entrance is located on the east side and is flanked by two grand marble staircases. The facade of the building is constructed of Indiana limestone, and is covered in terra cotta tiles. The Empire State Building is one of New York City's most recognizable landmarks, and is now a cultural center, with restaurants, retail shops, offices, hotels, and residential apartments.",

The last part of the entry has a map on it - I’m planning to write a separate post about that and why it is of such interest to me to travel that particular road. I’ve never been to the centre, but it seems like I might go there in the future. There are many different sights I’d like to see and many other roads to explore. One of the places I’d like to go to is the Zoo. It looks really pretty on Google Earth and I’d love to see some animal pictures. I’m guessing it would be easy to get to by public transport. The website says it’s 1 stop from the main train station, but that sounds like there are probably more stops. I’ll definitely be visiting it this summer, especially if I can go during the school holidays. Another place I’d like to go to is the Berlin Wall. That really brings back memories. I’m thinking that this trip I will try and go to the East Side Gallery first. I’d love to go again, but have not made it there since I moved back to London. I’d like to see how it has changed over the last few years. I’ve heard that there is an English speaking tour guide available to take you there - sounds like that would be a great idea.",
