In its history Lincolnshire has been ruled by the Romans, the Vikings, the Anglo-Saxons, the Normans, the Tudors, the Stuart kings and the Georgians (who, by 1751, held a vast majority of its 6,400 towns and villages), the current monarchs and numerous others who made their homes in the county over the centuries. The name Lincolnshire is thought to be derived from the word 'Ling, Louth and Lincoln', which means 'littlng, little', referring to a small town that lies within the county. Many of the region's towns and villages were established during the Roman period, which spanned over three centuries, from the reign of the emperor Augustus Augustus to the reign of Julius Caesar, and, in turn, the Romans also named parts of Lincolnshire after their own towns and peoples (Roman names such as 'Ling, Lincoln' and 'Louth' have survived to the present day)\nHowever, Lincolnshire has had a long history of human settlement, and many of its current landscapes owe their origins to the prehistoric time, and more specifically to the time in which the ice age ended in the area, and the first settled communities began to establish themselves on the landscape.",

After the death of the last of the Slavic kings, the Old Ukrainian language gave way to the Old Church Slavic dialect of Kyiv. This dialect was later replaced by the Middle and Modern Ukrainian dialect. In the 19th century, Slavic and Ukrainian culture came into contact with that of the Russian empire, and some Russian words found their way into the Ukrainian lexicon. In the 20th century, Ukrainian society was divided between a Ukrainian national element, and a Russian one. The latter was a majority and more influential component. However, the Ukrainians also played an important part in the struggle for Soviet independence from the Soviet Union.",
