The world was first introduced to Western Europe in Tolkien's The Silmarillion. It is known in the Tolkien lexicon as 'Middle-earth', in the Old English of the time as 'Middëarth', and the German Middle Earth.”\nHere is a beautiful, if perhaps not completely convincing, video of a medieval inspired band performing an album track titled “Middle Earth” in the middle of the woods. Perhaps this is a reference to a time or a land in which elves and other creatures existed and people still lived in close harmony with their environment. Certainly the Middle Earth of Tolkien's books is more fantastical than real, and has a more fantastical history than the one we find in the Middle East. We're glad to have come across this video today, as we are in the process of designing our own website, and are wondering how to include such a musical element in it. It looks like the band is playing a mix of medieval and modern, so this is what's possible for people today, perhaps not exactly in the woods of the Middle Earth of Tolkien's books, but certainly on the same musical road.",

During the Middle Ages, the city was the centre of the Roman Catholic Church in England, which made it a centre of shipbuilding and maritime trade. Southampton also became the centre of cloth trade and, as such, Southampton became known as \"Soton\" (or \"Southend\") and the largest seaport in the world. During the Industrial Revolution the city became the world's biggest centre for trade in Southampton-manufactured goods. Southampton's prosperity was helped by its location on the South Coast near the Isle of Wight. After the Industrial Revolution the city was established as a centre for the production of shipbuilding materials such as rope.
