For while music is an art, as opposed to science or politics, it is a relatively modern invention, having its origins in the Renaissance of the Renaissance and Renaissance composers such as Guillaume de Machaut, Johannes Brahms and George Bazanov, were all contemporary of Beethoven. Beethoven’s music, though, differed from most of these composers’ works. Beethoven, with more than three thousand compositions, was the most prolific composer of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century and his work spanned genres from the symphony and chamber works to opera and orchestral work. And although he was a leading figure of the 19th-century Romantic Era, he had the ability to be the most innovative composers in history — and for a man whose music so often had nothing to do with the Romantic Era, this is a feat to be highly commended. And, whilst Beethoven’s works have since been more and more replete with classical elements, such as the ‘Romantic’ symphony and Beethoven is also a leading classical composer in modern musical history. In recent years, Beethoven has become increasingly popular with contemporary composers, and, in this postmodern era, has the reputation of a figure whose musical style, if not his musical works, is much less familiar.",
