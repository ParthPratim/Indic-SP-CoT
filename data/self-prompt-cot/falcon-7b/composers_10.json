His music was largely learned from and adapted from the church choir at the Collegium musicale of St. Peter in Leipzig. While at Leipzig, Bach had three periods of employment, as the organist, music teacher, and composer. Bach wrote some of his most popular compositions, including his Symphony No. 40, during the early years of his career. When Bach was twenty-four, he wrote the Brandenburg Concertos.",

            "passage": "\"Henry Purcell (c. 1589 - 1659) was an English composer and organist. Although much less famous than some of his contemporaries such as Bach and Handel, he had a significant career and his music is performed to a modern audience. Purcell lived in the reign of James I and his last year was characterised by royal patronage from William III, in whose reign he also received a peerage. He was one of the most significant composers of the English classical period, though his fame was not well known until his popularity in the 19th century. Purcell's family background was quite important, and his father had a well-established career as a singer and poet. The composer's parents were among the first Anglican rectors to be baptised. They met with the Revd Richard Purcell, and, in 1611, his mother received a portrait of the composer painted by William Dobell. Henry Purcell was born in 1589 in London, the son of a professional singer and poet. He was born in the Purcell Alley of London, near St. Paul's Cathedral. He received his first education at the Merchant Taylor's school and, by the age of 10, his father, Henry Purcell senior, became a member of the Royal Chapel of the English College at Rome.",

He is considered one of the most influential composers in Western classical music history. Bachs music is known for its complexity, depth, and beauty. He is also known for his use of counterpoint, which is the art of combining melodies in a musical composition. Bachs most famous works include the Brandenburg Concertos, the Mass in B Minor, and the St. Matthew Passion. Bachs music is still performed and studied today, and his influence on modern music is still felt."

That's a huge contrast to what we have today. In Germany, you get 90% of the seats to parliament elected by party, which means only around 10% of the seats are elected through the vote of individuals. So, I'm curious to know how Germany has evolved to come up with a system like that, while the US was going the other way with the election of its own king for a time in the 18th century. It also makes me wonder if I'm doing something that I have always done in that regard, but don't even know it, until I'm given a perspective in which I have to reconsider what I do. The biggest difference of all is the structure. When we elect 200 people to the Bundestag (federal parliament), the people who are elected are the representatives for their specific constituencies (electoral districts). If any of them are elected as members of the Bundesrat (federal parliament) or parliament, it is because they were elected by their respective constituencies.

This is very much the case when you're from a multi-ethnic culture like mine. It's strange to see a \"real\" city like Berlin as a \"not-real-city\". And seeing this image in Germany I can't really help but think that Germany is not really a multi-ethnic country, though I know this is not the case.

His first appearance for Fulham was in an FA Cup game in 1982-83 against Millwall, where he scored twice in a 4-2 victory. At the time, James was on the same team as Paul Canovas, who was at the time playing as a defender. In 1983, the same year that Paul was sold to Fulham, James scored twice in 4-0 victory over Doncaster Rovers in a League Cup tie. In 1984, James played in the FA Cup Final against Sunderland, which finished in a 0-0 draw, but on 6 April 1985 he scored Fulham's first goal in a league match against Bristol Rovers. It was in 1985 when James signed a professional contract with Fulham, a contract which included a fee for the club of £500,000 for the remainder of his professional career. That same year, James scored 22 times for Fulham in all competitions, including 7 in the league which finished Fulham in 11th position. During the 1986-1987 season, James played a total of 18 games, scoring 8 times, 3 of which came in the league. The 1987-88 season saw James play more games as he played in 7 out of the 15 games.",
