The device was detonated at 9:52 AM in the city of Yongju. The South Korean and Japanese air forces responded immediately by firing hundreds of missiles, as the North Korean leader and his entire regime were considered enemies. Kim Jong Il and his regime began firing thousands of rounds of artillery against South Korea and Japan. He ordered for them to be used on the northern port of the South Korean city of Gyeongju. The South Korean military confirmed at 12:44 PM that the North had launched artillery fire. Two minutes later, 120mm mortars were also fired. The South Korean military announced at 2:04 PM that they had launched 5,000 rounds of artillery in response. South Korea launched an F-15E fighter aircraft to conduct \"precautionary strikes.\" The North Korean artillery began firing as well, and the South Korean military conducted a full scale alert in 2015.

It has caused death and injuries in the \"coalition\" forces and also has been criticized for civilian deaths. The number of civilian deaths in 2009 was 2,200, which was the highest in 2009, and is also still one of the highest of any year. The number of deaths attributed to \"civilian casualties\" has remained between 3,000 and 5,000 per year, while the number of deaths attributed to U.S. forces has risen between 1,000 and 2,500 per year. According to the United Nations' report on \"Extra-Judicial Killings\", more than 21,000 civilians died between 2002 and 2006 as a result of the United States-led occupation in Afghanistan. More than 50 percent of the deaths were attributed to U.S. forces. This is a photograph from the 2001 invasion:\nIt's a disturbing photograph because it depicts a soldier shooting at a man running away. If you look closely you can see that the man is only running away because the tank is firing at him. The reason I put this on here is because the occupation is still going on, and it's one of the most dangerous places to be in the world for civilians.",

A woman’s choice regarding abortion, or not having one, should be respected, and it is no place for government intervention. For those who say that the government should have “morality laws” regarding sexual intercourse, I say “no, I don’t want government interference. Period.” I believe that this nation, and the people of this nation, are better off with the government keeping their nose out of our business. So to those who believe that a woman should not have the right to choose what she does with her own body, I say “just don’t have sex.” Problem solved.",
