This is reflected in the numerous festivities throughout the country, particularly in larger cities such as Lisbon and Porto, when families gather to celebrate together. Portuguese people are known for the importance they place on having large social networks, and a typical Portuguese Christmas party is the celebration of the \"bacalhau com natas\" (salt cod and cream). This celebration is common throughout the country and often involves an entire family coming together to share a meal in a small home. This passage makes me think of the difference between family traditions and the holidays that we Americans celebrate. Although our holidays are based in large part on religion, family and religious holidays are less frequently celebrated here than in Portugal. I think the concept of \"bacalhau com natas\" (salt cod and cream) is a good example of a religious celebration, but it's so tied to family tradition that it's hard to separate the two in Portugal. Perhaps I'm romanticizing Portugal and its holiday traditions, but I can't help but want to celebrate all of them - large and small - with my own family and family in-laws. It has been a long time since I've done any research on Portugal, and in particular, Christmas traditions, but it's been fun looking up all of this!",

This sugar helps preserve the wine, even without a preservative like sulfites. The result is a sweet wine which you can drink on its own or with food. The main difference between white and red wine is the type of grape used. In white wine, the grapes are white (of course). In red wine, the grapes are red (of course).
