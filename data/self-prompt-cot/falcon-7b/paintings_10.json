            "passage": "\"The Kiss\" is a painting by Gustav Klimt painted in 1908. It depicts two lovers, lying in a comfortable embrace, their faces turned to each other and kissing. The painting is considered a landmark in modernism and a key work in the 'art of feeling'. Klimt's works with its sensuous and sensual characters, decorative and decorative elements have strongly influenced subsequent art. Klimt created at least two versions of The Kiss, one of which he showed to his friend and model (one of his models was later in a nude pose with a crown-like head). Klimt completed two works that included 'A Kiss' in a series of drawings (the other one is a painting of \"The Kiss\". They are both part of the same \"kissing\" scene). The painting was completed in May 1908. In November 1908 Gustav Klimt received the Gold Medal at the Society of Painters. The painting is today in the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna. -- [This entry was originally posted on the 27th of February, 2006.] This text has been marked for revision in order to improve it.

After my second day painting, I realized how the painting of this man had a similarity with the portrait of the man in the “Last Supper”. They are both man on the table with the woman to the left. The difference between the two is that Botticelli’s is in his 30’s whereas the “Last Supper” is in his mid-50’s. The “Last Supper” is of Jesus and his disciples in the 12th century in the Roman town of Leonardo da Vinci. They are seated around a table, which is common in the Middle Ages, with a dish of fish in the middle of the table. At the top, Jesus is in the center with a scarf around his head.

There are approximately 1,800 known paintings of Gustav Klimt’s artwork with most of them being oil paintings. Some of the most recognizable paintings are his works on canvas and his frescoes. Gustav Klimt’s work has been very popular in the United States and the United Kingdom. With many works in collections throughout Europe, many art museums have sought to acquire Klimt’s art. Among his most popular and sought-after works are ‘The Kiss’ and ‘Self-Portrait.’”\nI’ve been thinking of Gustav Klimt a lot lately.
