            "passage": "Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of microscopic objects and their interactions with the surrounding environment. It deals with the behavior of physical objects that are too small to be seen, such as atoms and subatomic particles. In contrast to classical mechanics, quantum mechanics is based on statistical mechanics, which is based on probability theory and the conservation of energy. In classical mechanics, physical quantities can only take certain values, while in quantum mechanics, the results of measurements may be in a superposition until the measurement is made. The results of measurements are never certain, but instead involve statistical likelihoods. This means that an event's probability is never guaranteed, and the measurement of one quantum system may influence the outcome of a subsequent measurement. The behavior of quantum systems is also fundamentally different from that of classical systems. To answer your question about the wave function and the square root of -1, it is important to understand that quantum mechanics deals with the behavior of small and incredibly tiny objects. When these objects interact with each other or with their environment, their state of being in a superposition or quantum state of existence is not guaranteed. The wave function of a particle is a mathematical tool that can be used to represent the probability that a particle exists in a certain region of space. In quantum mechanics, the wave function of a particle can have complex values, and it is not a true wave function but rather a probability function.",

Please don't take this out of context. It was a valid question about a wikipedia page, but you replied in a much more hostile manner than would normally be seen in the community. What do you mean by \"it's on the Wikipedia page.\" I'm not taking it out of context. I am trying to learn the appropriate response. Last edited by ~jimmy~; 12-11-12, 03:45 AM. Thanks for clearing that up. I was hoping someone would take the time to help me understand the appropriate response. What about \"How is it relevant here?\" I am trying to figure out the rules for using the word \"Wikipedia.\" Is there a better way to approach a question about information on the website?

In addition, when three objects come close to each other, they are also attracted to each other. This attraction is so strong that the gravitational force between the objects will keep pulling them to each other until the force is balanced out by the distance that the objects are from each other.”\nIf we are within a few miles of the Moon and we don’t see gravity effect us yet, I believe we are not being gravitationally affected because the Earth’s gravitational pull on the Moon is so strong, the Earth’s gravitational pull on the Moon is stronger and can overcome the Moon’s own gravitational attraction. But for us to be aware of the Moon’s gravitational effect, we would need to be in a position that is several times farther away. There is no need to have a large planet like Earth to be gravitationally affected. Even a small planet could have gravity that could affect us if we come in close enough to it, but the larger a planet is, the greater its gravity will be, and the weaker it will become the smaller it becomes. So, does a planet’s distance affect gravity? No, distance itself has no effect on gravity. Gravity is the attraction between all objects in space, and it is the same from millions of miles away as it is just a few miles away.",

Oscillatory motion can be found in many objects, such as pendulums or swing-arms.\" In the passage, the term \"displacement with respect to its fixed position\" means the distance or location of the point of an object in relation to a fixed point or position. It is different from linear motion where the distance or position of an object changes constantly and never changes with respect to a fixed position. In the case of pendulums, when the length of the pendulum is shortened or extended, it will still oscillate back and forth on its fixed point of equilibrium until the pendulum reaches its new equilibrium position. Similarly, with swing-arms, the position of the point on the swing-arm where it makes contact with the swinging body will constantly change, but the overall swing-motion can be seen as constant.",

I was amazed to find that a few years ago, the word was added to the dictionary only because it was found to be common to people in New Zealand. The word is very much in common use in English. The word has many interesting uses and meanings. I found several examples of the word in my home town:\n- I live near a park. I hear the birds singing KE, and I can see children playing KE. - My neighbor has a new puppy. I am often called out to feed the puppy KE. - The city is holding an annual KE festival. People are marching and dancing in the streets, singing KE. - I like to listen to KE. It's a pleasant music to hear.
