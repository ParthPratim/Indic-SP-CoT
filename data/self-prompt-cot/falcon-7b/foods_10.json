Egg whites are also used in various recipes, as they are often used as a meringue, whipped egg whites, and various desserts. An egg's size, shape, weight and shell color vary depending on breed and environmental factors. Domestic chickens lay a variety of colors ranging from white to brown. The color of the shell can range from green, blue, pink and brown depending on the breed. Egg yolk color varies between yellow, white and green. The size of the egg may range from tiny micro eggs to larger eggs. Micro-egg production has been in vogue in France since 2013 as a novelty item and can be found in various specialty shops. The average egg is about 6.2 grams of protein and about 1.7 grams of fat. They are also an excellent source of Vitamin A and E. An egg yolk contains an egg white and the yolk of the chicken in it. When broken, the egg white spills over, while the yolk and shell remain intact. The white of the egg contains proteins, as well as the shell.",

The majority of the world's population consumes cheese and it is a major component of many cultures. Cheese is made from a variety of dairy products, including milk, cream, and cheese curds. Most cheese is made from pasteurized dairy products, and can be classified into five main categories: soft, semi-hard, hard, blue and Gouda. Cheeses of these types are made from different ingredients and production methods, with different animal by-products, such as sheep's milk, goat's milk, and water buffalo's milk. Most cheeses undergo a process of bacterial conversion, as well as a process of fat separation, and are aged, if necessary, for several months. Most cheeses have a long shelf life, as well as the ability to be preserved for long periods of time. The primary flavor and texture differences among cheeses are produced by the production of lactic acid bacteria, molds, and the use of different animal by-products. In most countries, cheese is sold in the form of blocks, slabs, and shredded. Many cheeses can be prepared in a variety of flavors, as well as types and sizes. As of 2021, the worldwide production of cheese is approximately 8.5 billion pounds per year. The primary ingredients used in the production of cheese are animal products, such as milk, cream, and rennet.",

All animal flesh and organs can be used to make meat, as it contains the same protein that makes up human muscle. The term \"meat\" can include both meat and fish, but is more commonly used to refer to meat from mammals. Meat from mammals has been consumed by humans throughout human history. The consumption of meat varies widely across cultures and religions. In many societies, meat is a central part of meals and is considered a delicacy. In other cultures, meat is eaten for religious reasons. The term \"meat\" in English is also used to refer to the flesh of animals. The flesh of larger animals is usually considered \"red meat\". In the USA, the term \"white meat\" is used to refer to the flesh of animals that are used primarily for meat consumption. In the 1970s, the consumption of meat was estimated to be around 50 kilograms per person per year in the industrialised countries. In many developing countries and in the past, the consumption of meat has been much less than this.' According to the information I have gathered on the History of Meat and Animal Flesh in America, the first recorded history of meat consumption can be traced to approximately 500 BCE. Many ancient cultures have utilized meat from animals for food and medicinal purposes.",
