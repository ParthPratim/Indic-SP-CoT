In physics, spacetime is the space and time in which any physical event or any physical matter exists. The spacetime concept was introduced in 1915 by Albert Einstein in his Theory of Relativity. He has explained that spacetime is a single spacetime dimension, where all physical events, including gravitational waves, are related to this dimension. The spacetime is a dimension of spacetime itself. This dimension is not contained within the physical existence of the universe. Spacetime has not yet been proven by any experiment. So, it is still in its unproven stage. Spacetime theory may be an unproven physics theory of the whole existence of the universe.

            "passage": "The Google alphabet is a system of alphabetical indexing created by American linguist Edward A. Tufte in 1967 to facilitate the organization of information. Tufte created a standardized system of indexing that uses letters of the alphabet instead of numerals or other symbols. Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a numeric value, with letters assigned values ranging from 1 to 9. The Alphabet has many variations, but Tufte's system is the one most commonly used. In 1980, a related system of alphabets (called alphabetisation, which is itself defined as a system of \"alphabetical indexing and numbering\" but is similar to the English language alphabet in many respects) was developed by Swedish language model Lars Ekeberg. In 2000, a variation of the English alphabet was created in an experiment with the Unicode character set. It consists of letters A, B, and C, with no numerical values assigned to any of the letters. It is generally believed that the alphabet was created by Thomas Jefferson, a lawyer, educator and writer. During his tenure as the Secretary of the U.S. War Department, Jefferson, who became the author of the Declaration of Independence, used an alphabet derived from the phonetic pronunciation of letters to keep his correspondence in order. The letters in his alphabet are: 1=A, 2=B, 3=C, and so on.",
