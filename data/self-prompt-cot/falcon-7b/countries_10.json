Do we really need a constitution to have a Federal Constitutional Court? What’s that, you ask? The Federal Constitutional Court is in essence an “appellate court” and it is where you would be able to seek relief from a lower court’s decision. That is, if the lower court does not take the side of the individual being challenged, the higher court will reverse the decision. In Germany, as far as I know, the Federal Constitutional Court, or the Bundesverfassungsgericht in German, plays a similar role. But let’s get back to the point I started with. What is this “appellate” thing? Does it really make that much difference? I have been wondering, for many years, why Germany would bother to have such an entity. What has this court got to do with anything? It is not that I am doubting the decision, because I trust the German system. So, I have the answer.
