On January 15, 1924, a day after the film of the silent epic The Plumed Serpent opened at the Carthay Circle Theater in Santa Monica, California, a group of young Mexicans from Tijuana, led by Don Alejandro León and his wife, María Jesús Sánchez, walked into a local restaurant, and killed all the staff, including the manager and his wife, and an 18-year-old Mexican film operator who was working behind the scenes. The Mexican film, in which Mexican actors had replaced the Chinese characters that were normally used by Hollywood actors and actresses of Mexican origin in the early silent film era, was not popular. The León-Sánchez group, on the other hand, was a popular attraction in California, and the film, which they had brought from Mexico, became popular in other Latin American cities as well. The Mexican film, which was dubbed in English and was entitled Mexicali Dawn, was not shown for about three years and, in 1930, it was renamed Mexicali Rose, with the name changed to The Mexican. It received good reviews, and Mexican-Americans were proud of the Mexican actors. In 1929, the León-Sánchez group came to Mexico, and Mexicali Rose was popular in many Mexican cities.

My parents did that. My grand parents did that. My grand parents did that for their grandparents. There was a small town on the banks of the Mississippi where I learned that if you were a leader, you were there to lead and if you were in the \"wrong place\" or on the \"wrong team\", you better find a way to be the leader that would lead you back to a better place. I learned that by watching my father's example of becoming a successful entrepreneur and my mother's example of leading and being a \"leader\" to her children and her neighbors. She was very much a leader in her own community and we learned at home and on the street and on the playground how to \"be a leader\".
