While Ron and Harry get along well enough, they can never quite see eye-to-eye. Ron's main role is to provide comic relief, while Harry has a more serious role. While Ron's and Harry's friendship develops at various stages, they never become as close as he and Hermione. 2. In terms of his character development, Harry is often portrayed as being less courageous than his friend Ron. Ron is the one who takes risks and tries to take on dangerous tasks, while Harry is more hesitant and more prone to worry and doubt. Throughout the series, Harry's character evolves and changes in many ways, and he is often perceived as having a \"Harry-like\" personality by his peers. He is loyal, intelligent, and brave. He takes after his mother, who was a leader in the \"Quidditch\" team of the town. Like her, he is also very ambitious. In later books, he becomes an accomplished Quidditch player, and learns to use a Nimbus 2000 (the same type of broom that his friend Ron uses), while Ron remains more of a \"normal\" child, despite his magical talents. 3.",

They marched on a small village of unassuming wizards, and in the midst of this Voldemort was wounded by a spell from the old man, killing his body at the age of 149.”\nThe wizards and witches in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone are living in a world with a great deal of magic. In many of the magical places and cities and kingdoms, the wizarding families have the same rules and rituals and practices as they did in this 20th century time. Voldemort, on the other hand, and his death eaters are from the 12th century, which is also known as the Middle Ages. These were the time period in Europe from which many of our modern day Christian holidays came. Voldemort, or Tom Riddle in his human form, is a dark wizard. He was born as the son of Lucius and Rowena. His parents gave him a potion of a witch’s tears for the love of his father. He was not raised in a wizarding family, but was instead sent to a school called Durmstrang by his father where he was known as Tom Riddle. He attended Durmstrang and was eventually chosen as their champion. Voldemort was also known as a very skilled wizard in a variety of magical areas.",

That means (if we could read it right) he had to do a lot more than just ruling in 'Augusto' and his son 'Augusto' to be Emperor. So, yeah, Augusto, as you can see, was a busy man. Here is another passage from Wikipedia about him:\nAugustus was the son of Caesar and thus had a great chance of becoming Caesar. When Caesar was murdered, he was buried alongside Julius, his older brother. That's a lot to do. As a child, he was called 'Julian' which was also the name of the month of July. He is considered to be the father of the Roman Empire, that is, it's the Roman Empire that came later after Augustus' reign, not 'His Majesty's Empire, King Augie, or even King August, but the Roman Empire.",
