He began getting recognized by audiences for films like \"Far and Away\" in 1991. It wasn't until \"Top Gun\" in 1986 that he truly made an impact on the film industry and solidified his status as a star. He has since then achieved great success in films like \"Mission: Impossible\", \"Top Gun: Hot Shots\", and \"Magnolia\". Cruise has also achieved acclaim for his acting work, and has been recognized as an icon in the film industry. For his service in the 1990s, Cruise was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
