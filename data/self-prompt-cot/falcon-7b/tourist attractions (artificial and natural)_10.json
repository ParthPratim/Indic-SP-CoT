The name 'Great Wall' was likely coined by the 8th-century Persian ruler Bahraman in his famous poem 'Peril and the Perilous,' which referred to Chinese defenses against attacks from nomadic tribes from the north. The wall stretches about 7,500 miles (12,000 km) and is estimated to have taken up to 2,000 years to build. It has been continuously maintained and improved by the Chinese over the centuries. The Great Wall was built along the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) and extended in the 18th century by Qianlong (1744–1795), the 2nd emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). The Ming Dynasty's Great Wall, with its more than 20,000 watchtowers, was constructed in large numbers during the reign of Ming Dynasty Emperor Tung Ching, which lasted from 1392 to 1644.

Machu Picchu has been constructed over more than three centuries by different Inca dynasties and kings, each of which was used to expand the city by adding new structures and temples. The city was destroyed by the Spanish conquistadors in 1532, and many of its structures were destroyed as a result. Machu Picchu's ruins and structures are covered in vegetation and lichens, but the city was rediscovered by archaeologist and historian Hiram Bingham in 1911, when he found evidence of a structure at the height of 1,100 meters above sea level. After a lengthy series of excavations and research, a comprehensive restoration of the city was begun by archaeologist Richard F. Wallis in 1980, and was completed by 1998.

So far, we've heard about the 5 main categories of desert in the area, but I have a feeling that there are others there. How much of this do we know about? I have a very basic knowledge of this, that it is the area to the west of the Colorado River, which is a river itself that runs between Arizona, California, and the Sonoran Desert. The Desert is defined as any area with little rainfall or water, so the Sonoran could be classified as such. However, I can't think of any other deserts that are similarly defined as the one that Wikipedia mentions. Do we know about any others, or is the Sonoran the only one? So the only real reason that we know about this one in particular is that it was mentioned by Wikipedia, right?
