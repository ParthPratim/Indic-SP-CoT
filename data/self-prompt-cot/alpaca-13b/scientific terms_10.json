            "passage": "Cellular respiration is the process by which cells generate energy from nutrients, typically glucose. It occurs in three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Glycolysis takes place in the cell's cytoplasm and breaks down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, generating a small amount of energy in the form of ATP. The pyruvate then enters the mitochondria, where the Krebs cycle occurs. This cycle further breaks down the pyruvate, releasing electrons and producing more ATP. Finally, the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane uses the released electrons to generate a large amount of ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. The energy produced is then used to carry out various cellular functions.",

            "term": "Enzymes",
            "passage": "Enzymes are a class of molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions, allowing chemical processes to occur at a faster rate than they would otherwise. They are vital for life, as they enable organisms to carry out necessary chemical reactions at optimal rates. Enzymes are highly specific, meaning they catalyze only one or a few related reactions. Their catalytic power comes from their unique three-dimensional structure, which allows them to bind with the substrates and catalyze the reactions. Enzymes can be found in all living organisms, from bacteria to humans. They are often proteins, but can also be RNA molecules or even RNA-protein complexes. In humans, enzymes are produced by genes and are typically synthesized in the cell's ribosomes. Once synthesized, they are transported to the appropriate location within the cell, where they catalyze the necessary chemical reactions. Enzymes play a crucial role in metabolism, the process by which organisms break down and synthesize molecules. They are essential for processes such as digestion, where enzymes like amylase break down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars. They also play a vital role in cellular respiration, where enzymes like those in the citric acid cycle break down molecules like glucose, releasing energy in the form of ATP. The study of enzymes is an important field within biochemistry, as understanding their structure, function, and regulation can provide insights into various biological processes and potential areas for therapeutic intervention.",
