            "passage": "World War I (1914–1918), also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that began on July 28, 1914, and lasted until November 11, 1918. It involved the Axis powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria) and the Allied powers (United Kingdom, France, Russia, United States, and others). The war was primarily fought in Europe, but also extended to other regions, such as Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by a Serbian nationalist in June 1914 set off a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I. The conflict began with the German invasion of Poland on August 1, 1914, and continued until the signing of the Armistice between the Allies and Germany on November 11, 1918. The war resulted in the deaths of approximately 16 million people, both military and civilian. The aftermath of World War I led to significant political and territorial changes. The United States joined the war in 1917, and the Allies gained the upper hand. The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28, 1919, officially ending the war. Its harsh terms against Germany contributed to economic and political instability in Europe, which later fueled the rise of extremist ideologies and the events leading to World War II.",

                    "explanation": "While World War I primarily involved Europe, it also extended to other regions, such as Asia. The conflict triggered the Chinese Revolution in 1911, which led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Additionally, the Ottoman Empire's involvement in the war spurred nationalist movements in the Middle East, which later resulted in the creation of modern Turkey and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Thus, Asia was significantly impacted by World War I, even though it was primarily a European conflict."

The war was marked by the extensive use of air power and ground assaults, employing over 500,000 troops. The coalition's victory was achieved primarily by air superiority, which allowed for the successful implementation of a ground offensive, resulting in the liberation of Kuwait and the withdrawal of Iraqi forces. The war had a profound impact on global relations, leading to the establishment of the United Nations Security Council's six-month sanction on Iraq, which was intended to force the removal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and prevent the development of weapons of mass destruction. The Gulf War was the largest military conflict since World War II, with over 100,000 Iraqi soldiers killed in action and over 300,000 wounded. The coalition suffered 148 dead, with 77 dying in action, and more than 400 wounded. The war's outcome was a significant victory for the coalition, marking the end of major combat operations on 28 February 1991.

The war began on October 7, 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks on American soil, which were orchestrated by Al-Qaeda.

The primary objective of the invasion was to disarm Iraq of its nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, as well as its long-range missiles, in order to prevent the country from using them against the United States and its allies. The war began on March 19, 2003, with a massive aerial bombardment of Iraqi targets, followed by a ground invasion led by American and allied forces. The invasion resulted in the toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime, and the capture of the dictator on December 13, 2003.

The United States officially withdrew from Iraq on December 18, 2011, leaving the country's future security and governance in the hands of the Iraqi people.

Russian has a rich literary history, with authors such as Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Vladimir Nabokov contributing to its cultural prominence. The language has a complex grammar, with six cases for nouns (common, proper, possessive, concrete, indefinite, and definite), three genders (male, female, and neuter), and two numbers (singular and plural). Russian has borrowed extensively from other languages, particularly Greek, Latin, French, and German. The modern language has evolved over time, with the Old Russian language (10th to 13th centuries) giving way to the Middle Russian language (14th to 17th centuries), and eventually, the Modern Russian language (18th century to present). The Cyrillic alphabet, developed by the Bulgarians and later adopted by the Russians, is widely used in the Russian language. The alphabet consists of 33 letters, with each letter corresponding to a specific phoneme. The Russian language has several dialects, which can be broadly categorized as Northern, Southern, and Central Russian. The Northern Russian dialects are spoken in areas near the Arctic, while the Southern Russian dialects are spoken in the Caucasus region and the Black Sea coast. Central Russian dialects are spoken in the Moscow and St. Petersburg areas. The modern language has undergone significant changes since the 17th century, with some regional dialects becoming increasingly distinct from the standard language.
