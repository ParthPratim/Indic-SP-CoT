His style was characterized by the use of simple language, short sentences, and the elimination of unnecessary details. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954, \"for his powerful, highly concentrated, and emotional novel, The Old Man and the Sea, which, in its simplicity, expresses the essence of humanity.\" Born in Oak Park, Illinois, Hemingway was the second child and first son of Clarence Edmond and Grace Hall Hemingway. His father, a physician, was a respected community figure, and his mother, a trained nurse, had a strong influence on young Ernest. The family spent summers at a cabin near the shores of Lake Michigan, where they enjoyed outdoor activities, including fishing and hunting. These experiences later influenced the young writer's interest in nature and the outdoors. Hemingway's high school years were marked by his passion for sports, particularly boxing and football. He was also a member of the school's literary magazine, where he began to develop his writing skills. After graduating from high school in 1917, he enrolled at the Kansas City Star as a cub reporter. During World War I, he volunteered as an ambulance driver in Italy, which provided him with the material for his first novel, The Old Man and the Sea, published in 1952. In 1922, Hemingway moved to Paris, where he became part of the expatriate community. There, he met and befriended other writers, such as James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott Fitzgerald.",

Munro began writing stories at a young age, and her first publication was a poem titled 'The Wilds of Ontario' in a local newspaper when she was 16. She attended the University of Western Ontario, where she studied English and French, and later completed a Master's degree in English at the University of Toronto. While at the University of Toronto, she met her future husband, James Munro, a fellow student in the English program. They were married in 1951.
