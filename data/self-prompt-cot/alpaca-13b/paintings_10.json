He was born in a house on the Via Borgo Ognissanti, close to the church of the same name. Botticelli's career began to flourish in the 1470s, when he was employed by the Medici family, who supported many artists and humanists. He was primarily a painter of religious subjects, but he also painted a few mythological scenes, such as The Birth of Venus and Mars and Venus. These works are characterized by their grace, elegance, and balance. Botticelli's later works, especially those completed after his return to Florence in 1481, display a more monumental style, influenced by the sculptures of Donatello and Michelangelo. Botticelli's work was highly esteemed during his lifetime, and he was one of the most sought-after artists in Italy. However, his reputation declined somewhat during the Baroque period, and he was largely forgotten until the 19th century, when his work was rediscovered by art historians and critics. Today, Botticelli's paintings are some of the most famous and valuable in the world, and his influence remains strong in both painting and popular culture.",

            "passage": "Jean-Honoré Fragonard (1732 – 1799) was a French painter and printmaker whose late Rococo style was characterized by his use of vibrant colors, swirling forms, and strong contrasts of light and shade. Born in 1732 in Grasse, France, Fragonard was the son of a perfume manufacturer and showed early promise in art. He moved to Paris in 1750 to study under François Boucher, a prominent painter of the time. Fragonard's career blossomed, and he soon gained recognition for his graceful and expressive paintings, often depicting love, pleasure, and romantic adventure. Among his most renowned works are 'The Swing' (1767), 'The Stolen Kiss' (1771), and 'The Horse's Tail' (1773). Throughout his career, Fragonard received numerous commissions from the French aristocracy, which allowed him to maintain a successful studio. Despite the turbulent political climate in France during the Revolution, Fragonard continued to produce art, albeit with more conservative subjects. He died in 1799 in Paris, leaving behind a remarkable body of work that captures the spirit of the late Rococo era.",
