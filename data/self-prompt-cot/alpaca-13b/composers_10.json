            "passage": "Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) was a German composer and musician who is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western classical music. Born in Eisenach, Bach was a central figure in the Baroque period, and his compositions are renowned for their intellectual depth, emotional range, and technical brilliance. Throughout his career, Bach held several prominent positions, including organist at the Lutheran Church in Arnstadt, music director at the court of Weimar, and, finally, cantor and director of music at the St. Thomas School in Leipzig. Bach's compositions encompass a wide variety of genres, including sacred music, orchestral works, chamber music, and solo instrumental pieces. Among his most famous works are the Brandenburg Concertos, the Goldberg Variations, the Mass in B minor, and the St. Matthew Passion. His music often explores complex textures, intricate melodic lines, and innovative harmonic structures. Bach's influence on subsequent Western classical music is profound, as he significantly contributed to the development of tonality, counterpoint, and orchestration. Bach's compositions were not widely celebrated during his lifetime, but his reputation grew steadily after his death. Today, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western classical music, and his music remains an essential part of the classical music repertoire.",

He studied composition, piano, and conducting at the Hochschule für Musik in Freiburg im Breisgau, where his teachers included Klaus Huber and Wolfgang Fortner. Rihm's early works, such as his String Quartet No. 1 (1971), showed the influence of classical modernism, particularly the music of Béla Bartók and Igor Stravinsky. However, by the mid-1970s, Rihm had begun to develop a more personal style characterized by dense textures, complex rhythms, and the exploration of extremes in dynamics and register. This approach can be heard in works such as his Piano Concerto (1976) and the orchestral piece, Jakob Lenz (1979). In the 1980s, Rihm's music became increasingly chromatic and expressive, often juxtaposing contrasting elements within a single composition. This is evident in works like his String Quartet No. 2 (1981), the orchestral piece, Dionysos (1987), and the vocal piece, Die Hamletmaschine (1989–90), based on the play As You Like It by William Shakespeare. In the 1990s, Rihm continued to explore complex emotions and themes in his music, often drawing inspiration from literature, philosophy, and history. This period saw the composition of his large-scale orchestral work, Oedipus (1991), the chamber piece, Oktophonie (1993), and the choral work, Oedipus reaktionen (1995).",

Lenz was born in 1748 in the village of Winnenden, near Stuttgart, Germany. His father, a weaver, died when Lenz was young, leaving the family in poverty. Lenz attended the local school, where he showed early promise in language and literature. In 1767, he enrolled at the University of Tübingen to study theology, but soon abandoned his studies to pursue a literary career. Lenz's first major work, the collection of poems entitled 'Gedichte' ('Poems'), was published in 1770. The poems exhibited a strong influence of German Romanticism, particularly the works of Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Lenz's reputation as a poet grew, and he soon gained the patronage of Duke Carl Eugen of Württemberg. In 1774, Lenz moved to Stuttgart, where he became a member of the duke's court. There, he wrote several plays, including 'Der neue Meno' ('The New Meno') and 'Die Soldaten' ('The Soldiers'), both of which were performed at the court theater.
