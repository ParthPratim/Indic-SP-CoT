The majority of roses are native to Asia, with some species originating in Africa, Europe, and North America. The most popular colors for roses include red, white, pink, yellow, and orange, but they can also be found in purple, blue, and black. The rose has long been used as a symbol of love and beauty, and it is a popular choice for gardens, religious ceremonies, and floral arrangements. The ancient Romans and Greeks often used roses to decorate their temples and palaces, and they played a significant role in the culture and religion of the medieval period. The rose's medicinal properties have also been utilized throughout history, with some species being rich in vitamin C, which aids in the treatment of scurvy.

The plant is characterized by its tall, robust stem, which can reach heights of 3 meters (9 feet) or more. The leaves are broad, with a rough texture on the upper surface and a smooth lower surface. Sunflowers are known for their vibrant yellow or orange petals, which are often used for commercial and artistic purposes. The edible seeds, often referred to as sunflower seeds, are rich in fats and proteins and are a popular snack food. Sunflowers are also used in various industries, such as the cosmetics and food industries, where they provide natural ingredients like sunflower oil. The plant has a strong root system, which allows it to absorb nutrients efficiently and support other plants through the process of nitrogen fixation.

The plants thrive in partial to full shade, making them popular choices for landscaping under trees or in woodland gardens. They are versatile and can be used as groundcover, in borders, or in containers. Hostas are easy to grow and require little maintenance, but they do prefer well-drained, moist soil with a neutral to slightly acidic pH. They are often resistant to deer and rabbit damage. Hostas have been cultivated in Japan for centuries, and they were first introduced to Europe in the early 19th century. Today, they are popular among gardeners and are often used in botanical gardens and public parks.

After flowering, the agave dies, but its offspring, produced through vegetative propagation, continue the species. Agave's versatile leaves have many uses, including the production of fiber for clothing and ropes, as well as a sweet sap that can be fermented to create alcoholic beverages.

The generic name Allium is derived from the Latin word for garlic, 'allium'. The majority of Allium species are native to the Mediterranean region, with a significant number also occurring in the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. The genus includes both herbaceous perennials and annual plants, with a few species exhibiting winter annual behavior. The most distinguishing feature of Allium species is their bulbs, which are generally large, round, and often covered with a thin, papery skin. The leaves are often flat, broad, and linear, with the exception of a few species where they are more complex in shape. The flowers of Allium species are produced on tall, thin stems, and are generally cup-shaped with six petals, although there is considerable variation in flower shape within the genus. The stamens are shorter than the petals, and the anthers are generally yellow. The pollination mechanism is predominantly by bees, but some species also attract birds or other insects. The fruit of Allium species is a capsule containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by the wind or by animals that have eaten the fruits. The taxonomy of Allium has been a subject of debate and revision, with the current understanding based on the work of John L. Strother and colleagues. The genus is divided into three subgenera: Allium, Porrum, and Sativum. The subgenera are further divided into sections, with the most widely recognized being the onion-like bulbs of the Allium subg.",

Daffodils have large, trumpet-shaped flowers, which come in a wide range of colors, including yellow, orange, white, and red. The plants grow from bulbs, with each bulb producing one or more linear leaves, and a flower stem that bears the flower or flowers.

The daffodil is the national flower of Wales, and it is also widely used in British culture and literature, such as in the works of William Wordsworth and J. R. R. Tolkien. The name 'daffodil' is derived from the Welsh word 'daffod', which means 'to divide' or 'to break apart', possibly referring to the way the petals split apart as the flower matures. The daffodil is also known as the 'Lent Lily' because it often blooms during the Christian season of Lent.

They are characterized by their large, colorful, and fragrant blooms, which are often used in gardens and religious ceremonies. The tulip's bulbous stem is called a 'tuber’, and it stores starch for the plant's growth and development. The tulip's leaves are usually narrow and linear, and they emerge from the ground after the flower has bloomed. The species of tulips are native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southwest Asia, mainly in modern-day Turkey. They were first mentioned in the 10th century in the writings of the Persian scholar, Abu Muhammad Zakariya' al-Qazwini. The word 'tulip' may have been derived from the Persian word for 'turban', as the bulbous shape of the tuber resembles a turban. The tulip's popularity as a ornamental flower spread from the Ottoman Empire to the rest of the world during the 16th century. The Netherlands is famous for its vast fields of tulips, which attract millions of tourists annually. Today, tulips are used extensively in the cut flower industry, and they are also bred for various shapes, sizes, and colors.

Members of the Plantaginaceae are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves, and their small, inconspicuous flowers, which are usually blue, but can also be white, pink, or yellow. The family is of great ecological importance, as it provides food for numerous pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, and serves as a critical component of many grassland and scrubland ecosystems. Some species, such as the common blue indigo (Baptisia tinctoria), are valued for their textile dyeing properties, while others, like the prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola), are edible and have culinary uses.
