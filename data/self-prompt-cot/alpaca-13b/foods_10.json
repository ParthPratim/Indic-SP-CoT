The word 'yogurt' is a anglicized form of the Turkish word 'yogurt', which itself is derived from the Persian word 'yogurt'. The primary ingredient in yogurt is milk, which is fermented by specific bacteria, usually Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. These bacteria are responsible for the fermentation process that transforms milk's sugar (lactose) into lactic acid, which gives yogurt its tangy taste. The fermentation process also causes the milk to thicken, forming a gel-like consistency. The addition of fruit, flavorings, or sweeteners can further enhance yogurt's taste and texture. Yogurt is a good source of protein, calcium, and probiotics, which are beneficial live bacteria that can help maintain a healthy digestive system. The nutritional content of yogurt varies depending on the fat content of the milk used, the amount of milk solids, and the added ingredients. Yogurt can be low-fat, fat-free, or full-fat, with low-fat and fat-free varieties being more commonly found in the United States.

            "term": "Streptococcus",
            "passage": "Streptococcus is a genus of Gram-positive, coccoid bacteria that belong to the family Streptococcaceae. The genus Streptococcus comprises more than 70 species, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in humans. Other species of Streptococcus are also known to cause diseases in humans, such as S. pyogenes, which causes scarlet fever and rheumatic fever, and S. agalactiae, which causes neonatal meningitis and sepsis. The name 'Streptococcus' is derived from the Greek 'streptos' meaning 'twisted', as the bacteria exhibit a twisted or spiral shape under the microscope. These bacteria are opportunistic pathogens, meaning they can cause disease under certain conditions, such as when the host's immune system is weakened or when the bacteria invade tissues or organs. The cell wall of Streptococcus bacteria contains peptidoglycan, which makes them susceptible to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics.",
