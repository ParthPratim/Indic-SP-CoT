            "passage": "Vincent van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt vən ˈɣɔx]; 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1891) was a Post-Impressionist painter from the Netherlands. He is famous for his bold colors, emotional intensity, and innovative brushwork techniques. His work was often characterized by his use of contrasting colors and light. Van Gogh's artistic career was short, as he died at the age of 37 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Vincent van Gogh was born in 1853 in the village of Zundert, in the southern Netherlands. He was the son of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia van Gogh-Bonger. Van Gogh had a religious upbringing, and his father's strict discipline and conservative views would influence him deeply. In 1869, Van Gogh began working as an art dealer for the Parisian gallery, Goupil & Cie. In 1876, he was transferred to London, where he met and befriended the English artist Charles Dickens. It was during this time that Van Gogh began to develop his own artistic style, influenced by the Impressionist movement. In 1886, Van Gogh decided to pursue a career as an artist and moved to Paris, where he shared a studio with his friend, the artist Émile Bernard. In Paris, Van Gogh met and befriended many artists, including Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Paul Gauguin.",

Born in Vinci, Florence, Leonardo was the illegitimate son of a notary and a peasant woman. He was raised by his father, who gave him a basic education in Latin, writing, and mathematics. Leonardo's early life was marked by his fascination with the natural world, which was reflected in his notebooks, where he recorded observations and theories on topics such as anatomy, geology, and meteorology. In 1476, he moved to Florence to pursue his career as an artist, where he was influenced by the works of artists like Masaccio and Donatello. By 1482, he had established himself as a talented painter, and his works began to attract the attention of wealthy patrons. In 1489, he was invited to the court of Ludovico Sforza, where he remained until 1499. During this period, he worked on various projects, including the design of the Santa Maria delle Grazie's ceiling, which showcased his pioneering use of perspective. In 1503, Leonardo returned to Florence, where he continued to work on various commissions and develop inventions, such as a model of a helicopter and a tank. In 1516, he was invited to Rome by Pope Leo X, who sought his expertise in engineering and architecture. Leonardo died in 1519, at the age of 67, in Amboise, France.",

Born in Leiden, Rembrandt began his career as a portrait painter, but soon turned to landscape painting and then to the art of etching. He was influenced by the work of Italian artists, particularly in the use of chiaroscuro, and his paintings exhibit an extensive knowledge of anatomy, light, and shadow. In 1632, he moved to Amsterdam, where he spent the rest of his life. In 1648, he was bankrupt, and his possessions were sold to pay his debts. Despite this setback, Rembrandt continued to produce great works, including The Night Watch and The Mill. He also created numerous drawings and etchings, many of which were posthumously published. His work was admired by contemporaries and influential artists, such as Peter Paul Rubens and Claude Lorrain, and his style was emulated by many painters, such as Gianlorenzo Bernini and Caravaggio. Rembrandt's innovative and expressive style, which combined strong emotion and dramatic lighting, had a profound impact on the course of art history. His portraits, landscapes, and narrative paintings are considered masterpieces, and his prints have had an enduring influence on generations of artists.",

During his lifetime, he created numerous works that were critical of the Spanish government and the Catholic Church, which led to his being named a 'discoverer of truth' by his contemporaries. His style, which shifted from the early tenebrism to the later, more optimistic style known as 'sunshine painting,' was influential on numerous artists, such as Vincent van Gogh and Francisco de Zurbarán. Goya's later works, known as the Black Paintings, were painted on the walls and ceilings of his house in Madrid, and are some of the most famous works in the history of art. These works, characterized by their bleakness and focus on human suffering, were not publicly recognized until after his death. Goya died in 1798, and his remains were moved to the Royal Chapel of San Lorenzo de El Escorial in 1819.

He was well known for his drip painting technique, which involved pouring paint onto a canvas laid on the ground, and for his turbulent and chaotic artistic style. Pollock's artistic career began in the 1930s when he studied under Thomas Hart Benton at the Art Students League of New York. There, he learned about mural painting and developed an interest in social realism. In 1938, Pollock had his first solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. The following year, he joined the Federal Art Project, a New Deal program that employed artists during the Great Depression. In 1942, Pollock met the artist Lee Krasner, whom he married in 1945. The couple moved to Long Island, where they shared a studio. It was during this time that Pollock began experimenting with his drip painting technique. In 1947, he had his first solo exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York, which featured his new works. The exhibition established Pollock as a leading figure in the abstract expressionist movement. In 1950, Pollock's painting Convergence was featured in the landmark exhibition 15 Americans at the Museum of Modern Art. The following year, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which allowed him to work on large-scale paintings.",

His works include the iconic painting of a Campbell's Soup Can, numerous silkscreen paintings, and the film Andy Warhol's Frankenstein (1973). Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Czech immigrant parents, Warhol had a relatively quiet childhood, although he showed early promise in art. After studying at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), he moved to New York City in 1949, where he began working as a commercial artist. In the 1950s, he established himself as a successful illustrator, with clients such as Vogue and The New Yorker. In the early 1960s, Warhol began to produce paintings that would become synonymous with Pop Art. Using images from popular culture and everyday objects, he explored themes of mass production, consumerism, and celebrity. His work was exhibited in galleries and museums around the world, and in 1964, he founded the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Throughout his career, Warhol also worked in film, television, and music, producing and directing several underground films, and collaborating with artists such as the Velvet Underground and Nico. In 1968, he was shot by radical feminist Valerie Solanas, which left him critically injured. Despite the shooting, Warhol continued to work and maintain his socialite lifestyle in New York City until his death in 1987.",

Kahlo was born in Coyoacán, Mexico, to a Mexican father and a German mother. She suffered a traumatic accident at the age of 18, when she was involved in a bus accident that nearly took her life. The injuries she sustained during the accident, including a broken spinal column, a crushed foot, and a dislocated shoulder, left her in pain for the rest of her life. As a result, she began to paint, primarily self-portraits, which often expressed her emotional and physical pain, as well as her cultural identity. Kahlo's work was first exhibited in Mexico in 1929, and she soon gained recognition within the Mexican art scene. Her work was influential in the development of Mexican modernism, and she is considered a key figure in the evolution of 20th-century art. Throughout her life, Kahlo maintained a strong connection to her Mexican culture and heritage, which greatly influenced her artistic style and the content of her work. She married the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera in 1929, and the couple traveled extensively, living in the United States, Mexico, and Europe. Kahlo's health deteriorated over the years, and she eventually became unable to walk without the assistance of a cane or crutches. She died in 1954, at the age of 47, from a pulmonary embolism, likely exacerbated by her lifelong health issues and her injuries from the bus accident.",

It focuses on the development and application of mathematical tools that enable the prediction of the properties of systems with a large number of particles, such as gases, liquids, and solids. In particular, it investigates the properties of systems at the macroscopic scale, including the behavior of phase transitions, the nature of critical phenomena, and the principles governing the transport of heat and mass.
