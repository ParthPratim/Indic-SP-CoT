His work in mathematics, optics, gravitation, and physics laid the groundwork for many scientific advancements throughout history. Born in Lincolnshire, England, in 1642, Newton was the son of a prosperous farmer, also named Isaac Newton, and his mother, Hannah Ayscough. As a young boy, he attended the King's School, Grantham, where he began to show promise in mathematics and science. In 1661, he enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics, optics, and physics. While at Cambridge, Newton formed a close friendship with the college's Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, Isaac Barrow. Barrow introduced Newton to the work of Greek and Arabic mathematicians and scientists, which greatly influenced his future studies. In 1665, the University of Cambridge was closed due to the Great Plague, and Newton returned to his family's farm in Lincolnshire. It was during this time that he formulated his three laws of motion and began his work on calculus. In 1667, Newton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and the following year, he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in mathematics. In 1670, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at Cambridge, succeeding Barrow. In 1687, he published his seminal work, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which outlined his laws of motion, the law of universal gravitation, and his mathematical description of the physical world. This work established him as one of the most important scientists in history.",

            "term": "Charles Darwin",
            "passage": "Charles Darwin (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, biologist, and author. He is best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection, which he first described in his book 'On the Origin of Species' (1859). Darwin's work established that species evolve over time through a process he called 'descent with modification', and he provided evidence for this theory by presenting examples of adaptations in nature, such as the beak shapes of different bird species. Darwin's early interest in biology led him to neglect his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh, choosing instead to voyage on the Beagle, a British naval ship, as an unpaid naturalist from 1831 to 1836. During this voyage, he collected numerous specimens of flora and fauna, which provided the basis for his later work. In 1839, he began to formulate his theory of natural selection, which he later discussed in his book 'The Origin of Species'. The book sold out on the first day of publication, and it has continued to be widely read and studied. It provided a foundation for the development of biology as a modern science, and it remains a cornerstone of evolutionary theory. Darwin's work has had a profound impact on many aspects of human thought, including philosophy, religion, and science. His ideas have been both praised and criticized, but they have undoubtedly played a significant role in shaping our understanding of the natural world. Darwin's scientific contributions led to various scientific breakthroughs, including the development of genetics by his cousin, Sir Francis Galton, and the emergence of biological disciplines such as biogeography and paleontology.",

He is best known for his work on the theory of general relativity and his contributions to the understanding of black holes. Hawking was the first to propose using the theory of quantum gravity to understand the origin of the universe, a topic he has continued to work on throughout his career. In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle atrophy and weakness. Despite being given only a few years to live, Hawking continued his studies, became a professor at the University of Cambridge, and wrote several books including A Brief History of Time, which has sold over 10 million copies. Hawking is a fellow of the Royal Society and has received numerous awards and honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. He is also an Honorary Fellow of the American Physical Society and a lifetime member of the Council for the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings.

He is best known for his work on the structure of DNA and its role in genetic information. Watson and Francis Crick discovered the double-stranded structure of DNA in 1953, while working at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory. This discovery, later supported by X-ray diffraction data from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, led to the understanding of the molecular basis of genetic information and is considered one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century. Watson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962, along with Crick and Franklin (posthumously). Watson's early research focused on the study of viruses, particularly the tobacco mosaic virus. In 1950, he began working at the University of California, Berkeley, where he started his research on DNA. In 1953, Watson and Crick discovered the double-stranded structure of DNA, which was later confirmed by X-ray diffraction data provided by Franklin and Wilkins. This discovery laid the foundation for the understanding of genetic information transmission and led to the development of molecular biology, a field in which Watson made significant contributions. After receiving the Nobel Prize, Watson moved to Harvard University, where he established the Watson Laboratory of Molecular Biology. He became the director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1968, a position he held for 37 years.

            "passage": "Sir Ernest Rutherford (1871 – 1937) was a New Zealand-born British physicist and chemist who became known as the father of nuclear physics. He was the first person to split the atom, and he discovered the structure of the atom and the nature of the nuclear binding energy. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908 for his work on the structure of the atom. Rutherford was born in 1871 in the small farming community of Brightwater, New Zealand, to James Rutherford, a farmer, and his wife, Martha (née Thompson). The youngest of 12 children, he was expected to follow in his father's footsteps and become a farmer. However, Rutherford's intellect and curiosity led him to attend the local school, where he excelled in mathematics and science. In 1890, he won a scholarship to study at Canterbury College, University of New Zealand, in Christchurch. There, he pursued a degree in both physics and mathematics, and soon impressed his professors with his brilliance and hard work. In 1895, Rutherford was awarded a fellowship to study at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, under the direction of Sir William Crookes. Rutherford's research focused on the properties of atoms and their interactions with light and electricity. In 1900, he was appointed a lecturer in physics at the University of Manchester, where he established a research program. In 1904, Rutherford was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1907, he was appointed the first director of the newly established Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge.",

She was born in New York City to a Jewish family, and her interest in astronomy was sparked by a popular science book she read as a child. Rubin received her bachelor's degree in astronomy from Vassar College in 1948 and her doctorate in astronomy from Georgetown University in 1954. She began her career as a researcher at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, where she spent the majority of her career. Rubin's most significant contribution to astronomy was her work on the rotation of galaxies, which provided evidence for the existence of dark matter. She co-authored a paper in 1970 with Kent Ford and James Gunn that presented the first quantitative evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe. This paper is considered a milestone in the field of astronomy. Rubin also co-discovered the galaxy cluster Abell 2029, which is the largest known galaxy cluster at the time of its discovery. In 1993, Rubin became the first female astronomer to be awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics, alongside James Gunn and Kent Ford, for their work on the rotation of galaxies and the discovery of dark matter. Rubin continued her research at the Carnegie Institution until her retirement in 2002.

This theory was based on his observations of natural phenomena, such as the erosion of rocks and the formation of soil, and marked a turning point in the understanding of Earth's history. Hutton's work was influential in shaping the emerging field of geology and contributed to the eventual acceptance of the concept of deep time.

Romer received his early education in the local public schools, and then attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a B.S. in 1914. He continued his studies at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, receiving an M.D. in 1917. While at the medical school, Romer developed an interest in paleontology under the guidance of William Buckland and Edward Drinker Cope. He joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania as an instructor in paleontology in 1917, and was promoted to full professor in 1927. Romer's research focused on the anatomy and relationships of fossil animals, particularly fish and reptiles. He was a pioneer in the use of X-ray technology to study fossils. Romer's most significant work was his comprehensive textbook, Vertebrate Paleontology, which he co-authored with O.C. Marsh. This book, first published in 1937, became a standard reference in the field for many years. Romer was a member of various scientific organizations, including the American Philosophical Society and the National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Mary Clark Thompson Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1942. Romer retired from the University of Pennsylvania in 1956, but continued to teach and research until his death in 1973. He was survived by his wife, Marion, and their two children.",

Born in Paris, he was the son of the noted physicist and mathematician, Alexandre Becquerel. Henri Becquerel began his scientific career working with his father, who had discovered the photographic effect in 1839 but had not pursued the research further. Henri Becquerel continued the research and found that the photographic effect was caused by the absorption of light by various salts, resulting in the release of energy in the form of heat. This discovery led to the development of photographic materials that were more sensitive to light, such as the famous 'Becquerel plate'. In 1896, Henri Becquerel and the French physicist Pierre Curie discovered that uranium and thorium contain an unknown radiation that can expose photographic plates even when they are wrapped in black paper. This discovery laid the groundwork for the study of radioactivity and the understanding of the nature of the atom.",

Fossils of Megalosaurus have been found in Africa, Antarctica, and Australia, indicating a widespread distribution across Pangaea. The most famous specimen is the nearly complete skeleton of 'Megalosaurus' (now called Dinosauropus) found in 1844 by Rev. William Buckland in a quarry at Stonesfield, Oxfordshire, England. This skeleton is currently on display at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. The classification of Megalosaurus has been a subject of debate, as some scientists consider it a basal member of the Tyrannosauridae family, while others believe it is a more primitive form of dinosaur. Regardless of its exact classification, Megalosaurus serves as an important transitional fossil, providing insight into the early evolution of dinosaurs.",
