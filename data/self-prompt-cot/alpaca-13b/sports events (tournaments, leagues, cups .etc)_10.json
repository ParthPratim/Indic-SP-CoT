The competition was founded in 1960 as the League Cup, sponsored by the Daily Mirror newspaper. It was initially contested by the 92 clubs in the Football League, including those in the First and Second Divisions. The first winners were Aston Villa, who defeated Rotherham United 3–2 in the final at Wembley Stadium. The competition has been sponsored by various companies over the years, and has been known as the Rumbelows Cup, the Coca-Cola Cup, the Carling Cup, and the Capital One Cup. The current format involves all 92 Football League clubs, with the first round taking place in August and September, followed by a series of two-legged knockout ties culminating in a final at Wembley in February or March. The winner of the League Cup qualifies for the UEFA Europa League, unless they have already qualified for the UEFA Champions League through their league position. The competition has produced a number of memorable finals and performances, including a record-breaking nine-goal thriller between Liverpool and Manchester United in 1991. The League Cup has also provided a platform for several managers to make their names, such as Brian Clough, who won the competition with both Derby County and Nottingham Forest. The competition has also seen numerous players use it as a springboard to greater success, such as John Terry, who won the League Cup with Chelsea in 2005, before going on to win numerous other trophies.",
