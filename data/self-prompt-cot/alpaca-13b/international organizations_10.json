It was established in 1945 after the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of World War II. The organization has a membership of 193 countries, including all UN member states, observer states, and non-member states. The headquarters of the United Nations is located in New York City, United States. The United Nations is organized into several organs, such as the General Assembly, Security Council, and the Economic and Social Council. The General Assembly, composed of all UN member states, serves as a forum for member states to discuss and coordinate on international issues. The Security Council, consisting of 15 members, is responsible for maintaining international peace and security, and has the authority to establish peacekeeping operations and implement sanctions. The Economic and Social Council coordinates economic, social, and related policies among member states, and also serves as a forum for discussing international economic and social issues. The United Nations has played a significant role in international diplomacy, peacekeeping, and humanitarian assistance. It has also established international standards and norms, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and has worked to promote development, literacy, and gender equality. Despite its efforts, the United Nations has also been criticized for its failures, such as the inability to prevent the Rwandan genocide or the ongoing Syrian Civil War. The United Nations is funded primarily by assessed contributions from member states, which are calculated based on each country's ability to pay. The organization's total budget for 2019 was approximately $5.1 billion.",

It provides loans and financial assistance to member countries to help them address their balance of payments problems, stabilize their currencies, and finance their development projects. The IMF was created in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference, and currently has 189 member countries. Its headquarters are located in Washington, D.C., United States. The IMF's core activities include surveillance of member countries' economies, providing financial assistance through loans, and offering technical assistance to help countries improve their capacity and policymaking processes. The IMF's lending activities are focused on low-income countries, which receive financial aid through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) and the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The IMF also plays a significant role in global financial governance, working closely with other international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the European Union. The IMF's decision-making process involves a quota system, whereby the share of each country in the IMF's resources determines its voting power. The United States holds a dominant position in the IMF, with about 17% of the votes, while emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil have gained increased influence in recent years. The IMF's effectiveness as a global financial stabilizer has been both praised and criticized. Supporters argue that the IMF's loans help countries address economic crises and promote growth, while critics claim that the IMF's austerity measures exacerbate economic hardships and lead to increased poverty.",

The IAEA seeks to encourage the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, such as generating electricity, while preventing the misuse of nuclear technology for military purposes. The IAEA has three main roles: 1. Regulating nuclear energy use: The IAEA develops and enforces safety standards for nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities, and inspects these sites to ensure they comply with international safety and security regulations. 2. Promoting nuclear science: The IAEA supports research in nuclear science and technology, and helps member states improve their scientific capabilities through training and education. 3. Monitoring and verification: The IAEA plays a significant role in monitoring and verifying compliance with international agreements aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It has a comprehensive safeguards agreement with most countries that have nuclear facilities, which allows the IAEA to inspect nuclear sites and verify that nuclear materials are not being diverted for military purposes. The IAEA also conducts investigations in response to allegations of possible nuclear weapon programs, as was the case in Iran and North Korea. In addition to its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, the IAEA has three regional offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina (for Latin America and the Caribbean); Tokyo, Japan (for Asia and the Pacific); and Brussels, Belgium (for Europe).",

The government controlled nearly every aspect of life through the Führerprinzip (leadership principle), which called for absolute obedience to Hitler and his chosen leaders. The regime implemented a vast propaganda campaign, using mass rallies, films, and newspapers to indoctrinate the population and promote the regime's ideals. The Holocaust, the systematic extermination of European Jews, was a central part of the regime's racial policy. In addition to the Holocaust, Nazi Germany also carried out eugenics programs, involuntary euthanasia, and the enslavement of millions of people, including concentration camp inmates and forced laborers.
