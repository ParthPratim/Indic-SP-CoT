Sunflower seeds are produced in the flower head and are surrounded by a hard, woody shell. When the seeds are mature, they are harvested and dried before being shelled. The seeds can be roasted, ground into a meal, or used to make oil. Sunflower oil is extracted from the seeds by pressing them, and it is commonly used in cooking and as a base for salad dressings. Sunflower plants are also used as a source of food for humans and animals. The leaves and stems are edible and can be cooked like spinach. The roots can be roasted and used as a coffee substitute.
