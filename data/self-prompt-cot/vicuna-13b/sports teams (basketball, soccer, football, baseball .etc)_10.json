He is best known for his unique style, which was influenced by Catalan art and culture, as well as by his studies in Barcelona and his travels to other parts of Europe. Gaudí's works are characterized by their use of organic forms, bright colors, and a distinctive style that often incorporates elements of the Art Nouveau movement. Gaudí's most famous works include the Sagrada Família, a large unfinished Roman Catholic basilica in Barcelona, and the Casa Batlló, a house in the center of Barcelona that was redesigned in the early 1900s. He also designed the Park Güell, a garden complex with houses and pavilions, as well as the Casa Milà, also known as La Pedrera, a building in the Eixample district of Barcelona. Gaudí's work was influenced by a range of factors, including his religious beliefs, his interest in nature, and his admiration for the work of other architects. He was also known for his innovative use of materials, such as ceramics and wrought iron, and for his attention to detail, which is evident in all of his works. Despite his reputation as one of the most innovative architects of his time, Gaudí's work was not widely recognized during his lifetime.
