It was first released in Japan on October 23, 1985, and later in North America and Europe in 1986. The game follows the adventures of Mario and his brother Luigi as they navigate through various levels to rescue Princess Toadstool from the evil Bowser. Super Mario Bros. was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. It was the first Mario game to feature power-ups such as mushrooms and fire flowers, which gave Mario special abilities to help him through the game. The game also introduced new enemies and obstacles, including Goombas, Koopa Troopas, and pipes that Mario could use to travel between levels. The game's graphics and sound were praised for their innovative use of color and animation. The game's music, composed by Koji Kondo, has become iconic and is still recognized and enjoyed by fans today. Super Mario Bros. was also influential in popularizing the side-scrolling platformer genre and paving the way for future Mario games. The game's success led to the creation of numerous sequels and spin-offs, including Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, and Super Mario World. These games continued to build on the formula established by the original game, adding new power-ups, enemies, and levels to explore. In addition to its popularity as a video game, Super Mario Bros. has also had a significant impact on popular culture. The characters and themes of the game have been referenced and parodied in countless movies, TV shows, and other media.",
