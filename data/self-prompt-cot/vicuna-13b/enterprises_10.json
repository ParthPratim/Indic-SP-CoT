The product was introduced as a response to the growing concern about obesity and weight gain in the United States during the 1980s. Diet Coke is available in over 160 markets around the world and is offered in a variety of sizes, including 6, 8, 12, 16, and 20-ounce bottles and cans, as well as 2-liter bottles and 12-ounce cans. The beverage is sweetened with aspartame, a low-calorie sweetener, rather than sugar. Diet Coke has been a popular soft drink for decades, and it has become one of the most popular soft drinks in the world. The beverage has undergone several changes in packaging and formula over the years, including a major overhaul in 2018, which saw the introduction of a new logo and a reformulation of the beverage's flavor profile. Despite its popularity, Diet Coke has faced some criticism over the years, particularly with regards to its use of aspartame as a sweetener. Some critics have suggested that the sweetener may be linked to health problems such as cancer, although the scientific evidence to support these claims is limited. Overall, Diet Coke remains a popular and widely consumed soft drink, with a loyal following of fans who enjoy its crisp, refreshing taste and low-calorie formula.",

Wozniak's Apple I was the first commercially successful personal computer, and foreshadowed the computing revolution that would change the world. Wozniak was born in San Jose, California, in 1950. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. While at Berkeley, Wozniak designed and built the Apple I computer as a hobby, and eventually formed Apple with Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne. Wozniak's design for the Apple I was based on the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, which he had learned about while working at Hewlett-Packard. The computer was sold for $666.66, and was the first to feature a color video display and expandability. After leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak continued to work in the technology industry, founding several companies and investing in others. He has also been involved in various philanthropic efforts, including education and environmental causes. Today, Wozniak is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of computing, and his contributions to the development of personal computers have had a lasting impact on society.",
