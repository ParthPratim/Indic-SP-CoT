The painting is 460 cm long and 880 cm wide, and covers the wall of the dining hall at the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. It is one of the most famous paintings in the world and is considered a masterpiece of Renaissance art. The painting shows Jesus and the twelve apostles seated around a long, rectangular table. Jesus is depicted as the central figure, with John the Apostle leaning on his shoulder. The other apostles are seated in groups of three, with Peter and Paul on either side of Jesus. The apostles are all shown with different expressions and gestures, creating a sense of drama and tension. The Last Supper was a significant event in Christian theology, as it marked the beginning of the end of Jesus' time on Earth. The painting itself is also significant, as it represents a departure from traditional religious art of the time, which tended to be more formal and stiff. Leonardo da Vinci's use of perspective, light, and shadow in the painting creates a sense of depth and realism that was revolutionary at the time. The Last Supper has undergone several restorations over the years, with the most recent one completed in 1999. Despite the restorations, the painting has suffered significant damage over the centuries, including cracks in the plaster, peeling paint, and damage from moisture and pollution. However, the painting remains a testament to Leonardo da Vinci's artistic genius and continues to inspire awe and wonder in visitors from around the world.",

Many houses built in the American Gothic style feature tall, narrow windows, asymmetrical facades, and ornate details such as gables and finials. One of the most famous examples of American Gothic architecture is the \"American Gothic House\" in Eldon, Iowa. The house, which was built in 1882, is now a popular tourist attraction and has been featured in numerous films and television shows.

            "passage": "--- On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina, a Category 5 hurricane, struck the Gulf Coast of the United States. The storm caused widespread destruction and devastation, particularly in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. Over 1,800 people lost their lives, and many more were left homeless or displaced. The hurricane also caused an estimated $125 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. The day before the hurricane hit, many residents of New Orleans were warned to evacuate the city, but many chose to stay behind. As the storm approached, winds and rains began to pick up, and many people hunkered down in their homes or sought shelter in public buildings. However, the levees that protected the city from flooding were not up to the task, and as the storm surge from the Mississippi River overwhelmed the levees, the city quickly became submerged in several feet of water. As the hours turned into days, rescue efforts were hampered by the sheer scale of the disaster and the lack of resources available to respond to it. Many people were trapped in their homes or stranded on rooftops, with no food, water, or medical attention. The situation was made even more dire by the hot and humid weather, which caused dehydration and heat exhaustion among those who were trying to escape the city. The aftermath of the hurricane was equally difficult. Many people were left without homes or access to basic necessities like food and medical care. The recovery effort was slow and difficult, with many people feeling abandoned by the government and other organizations that were supposed to help them.",
