The WTO also works to reduce trade barriers, such as tariffs and quotas, and to promote economic cooperation among its members. The WTO operates through a number of different bodies, including the Ministerial Conference, which is made up of trade ministers from each member state and meets every two years to review the organization's work and make decisions on major issues; the General Council, which is made up of representatives from each member state and meets regularly to discuss trade issues; and various subsidiary bodies, such as working groups and expert groups, which deal with specific issues related to trade.

Cabral claimed the land for Portugal and named it \"Terra de Vera Cruz\" (Land of the True Cross). He continued his journey to India, where he established a trading post at Calicut. Cabral made a second voyage to India in 1503, but died on his way back to Portugal in 1520.

The party was formed by a group of left-wing activists who had been involved in the pro-democracy and labor movements in the 1960s and 1970s. The party's initial goal was to promote democratic socialism and workers' rights in South Korea. The party's early leaders included Kim Dae-jung, who later became the country's president, and Kim Yong-sam, who served as the party's first chairman. The party's platform called for land reform, nationalization of key industries, and workers' rights. The party faced significant opposition from the government, which was dominated by conservative and authoritarian forces. The party was banned in 1980, and many of its members were arrested and imprisoned. After the end of authoritarian rule in South Korea in the late 1980s, the party was reconstituted and began to participate in electoral politics. The party has since become one of the largest opposition parties in South Korea, and has played a key role in advocating for workers' rights and social justice. Despite its history of opposition, the party has been able to build a strong base of support among workers and progressive activists. The party has also been able to attract support from young people and students, who have been drawn to the party's commitment to social justice and democratic values. Today, the Workers' Party is led by Lee Jeong-mi, who has been party leader since 2018.",
