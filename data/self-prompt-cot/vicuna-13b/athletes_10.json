He is remembered as the person who led the European discovery of the Americas, although his legacy is controversial due to his treatment of the indigenous Taíno people of the Caribbean islands. Columbus was born in the Italian city of Genoa in 1451. He began his seafaring career at a young age, and in 1485, he convinced the Catholic Monarchs of Spain to fund his voyage to Asia via the Atlantic Ocean. After reaching the Caribbean islands, he continued to explore the coasts of South and Central America, claiming them for Spain. Columbus made three more voyages to the Americas, sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs, and during his second voyage, he founded the settlement of La Isabela on the island of Hispaniola. However, his treatment of the indigenous Taíno people was brutal, and he ordered his men to enslave them and extract gold and other resources from their land. Columbus' legacy is a subject of debate, with some viewing him as a hero and others as a villain. Many countries celebrate Columbus Day on the second Monday of October to commemorate his voyages and achievements, while others have replaced the holiday with Indigenous Peoples' Day to recognize the mistreatment of indigenous peoples by European colonizers.",
