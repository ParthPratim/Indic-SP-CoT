The sinking of Titanic remains one of the most famous maritime disasters in history, and has inspired numerous books, films, and other works of art. The ship was owned by the White Star Line and was built in Belfast, Northern Ireland. At the time of its launch, Titanic was the largest ship in the world, and was considered to be unsinkable due to its advanced design and construction. However, on the night of 14 April 1912, the ship struck an iceberg and began to sink. Despite the efforts of the crew and passengers to save themselves and others, over 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster. The sinking of Titanic prompted widespread public outcry and led to the introduction of new safety regulations for ships. Today, the wreckage of Titanic lies on the seabed of the North Atlantic, and is a popular destination for deep-sea diving expeditions. The ship's story has also been the subject of numerous documentaries, exhibitions, and other forms of media, and continues to capture the public's imagination more than a century after its tragic demise.",

The term is derived from the Old French word revenant, meaning \"one who returns,\" and was first used in English in the 14th century. Revenants are often associated with folklore and legends from various cultures around the world. In some stories, they are depicted as mindless undead creatures with no memory of their past life, while in others they are portrayed as vengeful spirits seeking to settle old scores. One famous example of a revenant is the character of Valjean in Victor Hugo's novel Les Misérables. After spending 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread, Valjean is released on parole and becomes a respected member of society. However, he is haunted by the ghost of a man he wronged in the past, who eventually drives him to take his own life. Revenants have also been a popular theme in horror fiction and film, such as in the movie The Revenant, which tells the story of a fur trapper who is mauled by a bear and left for dead. After surviving the attack, he returns to seek revenge on those who wronged him. Overall, the concept of the revenant has captured the imagination of people for centuries, and continues to be a popular subject in literature, film, and folklore.",
