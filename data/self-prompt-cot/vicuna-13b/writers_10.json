            "passage": "Ernest Hemingway was an American novelist, short-story writer, and journalist who lived from 1899 to 1961. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, known for his distinctive style that emphasized clarity, precision, and understatement. Hemingway's spare, powerful prose and his exploration of universal themes such as love, loss, and the struggle for meaning in a chaotic world have had a profound impact on modern literature. Hemingway was born in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and grew up in a family of modest means. He began writing at a young age and was a high school sports reporter for the Kansas City Star. After graduating from high school, Hemingway worked as a reporter for several newspapers before moving to Paris in 1921, where he became part of the expatriate community that included Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. In Paris, Hemingway began to develop his distinctive writing style, which emphasized short, simple sentences and eliminated extraneous details. His first novel, \"The Sun Also Rises,\" was published in 1926 and received critical acclaim for its portrayal of the \"Lost Generation\" of World War I veterans. Hemingway went on to write several more novels, including \"A Farewell to Arms\" and \"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\" as well as numerous short stories, including \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway's personal life was marked by tragedy and turmoil.",

            "passage": "Jane Austen (16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which include Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, and Emma. Her works are noted for their wit, social commentary, and realism, and are often set in the Georgian era. Austen's writing is characterized by a strong emphasis on character development and social relationships, and she is often considered a writer of the English Regency era. Austen's life was marked by a lack of personal relationships and limited social interactions, which may have contributed to her sharp observations of the social interactions around her. She lived her entire life in the countryside, and her experiences were limited to the small towns and villages where she lived. Despite this, Austen's writing was widely read and appreciated during her lifetime, and she was supported by a small but dedicated group of readers and admirers. Austen's writing was also influential in shaping the literary landscape of the 19th century, and her works continue to be widely read and studied today. Her novels have been adapted into numerous films, television series, and stage productions, and her influence can be seen in the works of many contemporary writers. Austen's personal life was marked by tragedy and illness, and she died at the age of 41 from a mysterious illness that has been speculated to be Addison's disease. Despite her relatively short life and limited social interactions, Austen's writing continues to captivate readers and inspire new generations of writers and scholars.",

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. Shakespeare's works are known for their exploration of human nature, their mastery of language, and their enduring emotional and intellectual impact. Shakespeare's works include 38 plays, 154 sonnets, and two long narrative poems. His plays are divided into comedies, tragedies, and histories. Some of his most famous plays include Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, and Hamlet. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born to John Shakespeare, a successful glover and local politician, and Mary Arden, the daughter of a well-respected farmer. He was the third of eight children. Shakespeare attended the local grammar school, where he learned Latin and Greek, but he did not attend university. Instead, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman from a nearby village, in 1582, when he was 18. The couple had three children, Susanna, Hamnet, and Judith. Shakespeare moved to London in the late 1580s and began his career as an actor and playwright. He became a member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company of actors who were patronized by the king. Shakespeare wrote his first play, Henry VI, Part One, in the mid-1590s.",

Orwell is best known for his dystopian novels, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, which are widely regarded as two of the most influential works of literature of the 20th century. Orwell was born in Motihari, Bengal, India, in 1903. His father was a British civil servant, and his mother was a member of the Theosophical Society. Orwell attended Eton College and then served as a police officer in Burma, where he gained a deep understanding of imperialism and the oppression of the working class. After returning to England, Orwell became a writer and joined the Communist Party. However, he quickly became disillusioned with the party and resigned in 1949. He then wrote Animal Farm, a satirical allegory that criticized the Soviet Union and its leader, Joseph Stalin. Orwell's most famous work, Nineteen Eighty-Four, was published in 1949. The novel is set in a dystopian society where the government controls every aspect of people's lives, and independent thought is forbidden. The novel has been interpreted as a critique of totalitarianism and authoritarianism, and it remains a popular and influential work today. Orwell was married twice and had one son. He died in 1950 at the age of 46 from tuberculosis. Despite his relatively short life, Orwell's work continues to inspire and influence writers and thinkers around the world.",

She was born Adeline Virginia Stephen on January 25, 1882, in Kensington, London, England, to Sir Leslie Stephen and Julia Prinsep Duckworth. Woolf's childhood was marked by tragedy, as her mother died of an embolism when she was just 13 years old, and her half-sister, Stella, died of typhoid fever at the age of 18. Woolf attended the prestigious King's College London, where she excelled in literature and philosophy. After graduating, she began writing her first novel, The Voyage Out, which was published in 1915. She went on to write many more novels, including Mrs. Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927), and Orlando (1928), as well as essays, short stories, and non-fiction works. Woolf was a member of the Bloomsbury Group, a group of artists and intellectuals who were known for their progressive ideas and unconventional lifestyles. She was also a feminist and a pacifist, and her writing often reflected these beliefs. In 1941, Woolf suffered a mental breakdown and spent time in a psychiatric hospital. She continued to write, but her work became increasingly experimental and abstract. She took her own life on March 28, 1941, at the age of 59, by filling a basket with stones and walking into the River Ouse.",

He is best known for his novels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), which are considered among the great works of American literature. Twain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, a town that would later inspire the fictional setting of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He began his career as a printer and journalist, and in 1861 he joined the Confederate Army, but he left after only a few months due to illness. After the war, he moved to New York City, where he worked as a writer and humorist, gaining national attention for his lectures and sketches. Twain was a prolific writer, and his works include novels, short stories, essays, and travel books. He was also known for his use of colloquial language and his humor, which often relied on satire and irony. In addition to his literary achievements, Twain was also a businessman and inventor, holding several patents for inventions such as a \"self-pasting\" scrapbook and a \"telescoping\" concertina. Twain was married three times and had four children. He was also known for his philanthropy, donating large sums of money to charities and causes such as the Red Cross and the YMCA. Despite his success, Twain faced financial difficulties in his later years, and he was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1894.",

Her writing explored the African American experience, the trauma of slavery, and the search for identity. She was the first African American woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, and she was known for her distinctive prose style, which was characterized by its rich, poetic language and its exploration of the complexities of human relationships. Morrison was born Chloe Anthony Wofford on February 18, 1931, in Lorain, Ohio, to Ramah and George Wofford. Her parents moved to Ohio from the South to escape the racism and segregation they faced in the Jim Crow era. Morrison attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where she studied English and philosophy. After graduating in 1953, she worked as an editor at Random House and later at several other publishing houses. Morrison's first novel, The Bluest Eye, was published in 1970. The novel tells the story of a young black girl named Pecola Breedlove who is raped by her father and becomes pregnant. The novel explores the themes of racism, sexism, and the trauma of slavery. Morrison's second novel, Sula, was published in 1973 and tells the story of two black women who grow up together in a small Ohio town. Her third novel, Song of Solomon, was published in 1977 and follows the life of a black man named Macon Dead Jr. as he searches for his identity.",

The story takes place during the reign of King Sennacherib, who has invaded the land of Judah and is laying siege to the city of Jerusalem. Judith, who lives in the city of Bethulia, decides to take matters into her own hands and save her people from the Assyrian army. She goes to the Assyrian camp and seduces the general, Holofernes, with her beauty and charm. She then takes his sword and beheads him, and she takes his head back to her people as a trophy. The Assyrian army flees in terror, and Judith is hailed as a hero. In the Quran, Judith is mentioned in Surah 2:61, where she is described as a woman who was \"chosen above the women of the world.\" She is also mentioned in Surah 6:84, where she is described as a \"good woman.\" Judith is a symbol of strength, courage, and faith. Her story is a reminder that even in the face of great adversity, we can find the strength to overcome our enemies and save our people.",

It is approximately 70 miles (112 km) long, and its catchment area is 1,020 square miles (2,640 km²). The river rises on the moors between Skipton and Ilkley, and flows through the towns of Otley, Wetherby, Tadcaster, and Selby before emptying into the Humber Estuary at the village of Paull. The river has a long history of flooding, and has been the subject of several major flood relief schemes. In the 19th century, the river was straightened and canalised in some parts to improve navigation, but this has had the effect of increasing the risk of flooding in other areas. The river is home to a variety of wildlife, including salmon, trout, eels, and otters. It is also an important source of water for agriculture and industry, and is used for recreational activities such as fishing and boating. The River Ouse is a significant river in British history, as it played a key role in the Industrial Revolution. The river was used to transport goods and raw materials between the Yorkshire coalfields and the ports of Hull and Selby, and the construction of the Aire and Calder Navigation in the 17th century helped to further facilitate trade. Today, the River Ouse remains an important waterway, and efforts are being made to improve its ecological health and protect it from the effects of climate change.",
