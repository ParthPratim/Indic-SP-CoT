The wall was constructed from the 7th century BC onwards, with many different states building walls at their own borders. However, most of the existing wall was built during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). The Great Wall stretches for over 13,000 miles (21,000 km), from the eastern coast of China to the western desert. It is the longest wall in the world, and is visible from space. The wall was built to protect China from invaders from the north, including the Mongols, Manchus, and other nomadic tribes. The wall was also used to regulate trade and immigration, and to prevent the spread of disease. The construction of the Great Wall was a massive undertaking, involving millions of workers over centuries. The wall was built using a variety of materials, depending on the location and the resources available. In some areas, the wall was built using stones brought from nearby quarries, while in others, it was built using earth and other natural materials. The wall was also fortified with watchtowers, forts, and other defensive structures. Today, the Great Wall of China is one of the most famous landmarks in the world, attracting millions of visitors each year. It is also a symbol of Chinese strength and resilience, and a testament to the ingenuity and determination of the Chinese people.",

However, it was not until October 28, 1886, that the statue was dedicated as a symbol of freedom and democracy. The statue is of a woman who holds a torch and a tablet inscribed with July 4, 1776, the date of the American Declaration of Independence. The statue is an icon of freedom and has welcomed millions of immigrants to the United States through its port of New York City. It is also a popular tourist destination in New York City. The statue is made of copper sheets, which have oxidized to a green patina over time. It stands at a height of 151 feet (46 meters) from the ground to the tip of its torch.

            "passage": "The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km), three-mile-long (4.8 km) channel between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the American city of San Francisco, California, to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge’s span length was previously the longest in the world, and it has been called one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The idea for a bridge across the Golden Gate Strait was first proposed in 1917 by a San Francisco Bulletin journalist named James Wilkins. He wrote an article titled “The Most Beautiful Bridge in the World Will Be Built in San Francisco Bay,” which helped to popularize the idea. However, it was not until 1930 that construction began on the bridge, which was designed by Joseph Strauss, a civil engineer who had previously worked on the construction of the Bay Bridge in Oakland, California. The bridge was built by the American Bridge Company, which employed thousands of workers during its construction. The project was completed on April 19, 1937, and the bridge was opened to pedestrian traffic on the following day. Vehicular traffic was allowed to cross the bridge on the morning of April 20, 1937. The Golden Gate Bridge is a popular tourist destination, with millions of visitors each year. It is also a symbol of San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area, and has been featured in numerous films, television shows, and other forms of media. In addition to its aesthetic and cultural significance, the Golden Gate Bridge is also an important transportation link between San Francisco and the surrounding region.",

The Northern Lights are typically seen in the late evening or early morning hours, and are most active during periods of high solar wind. The colors of the Northern Lights can range from green, pink, purple, and blue, and can sometimes be seen as far south as the United States and the United Kingdom. The Northern Lights have been a source of inspiration for artists and writers throughout history. In many cultures, the Northern Lights are associated with myths and legends, and are often seen as a symbol of hope, renewal, and the beauty of nature. Scientists continue to study the Northern Lights in order to better understand the Earth's atmosphere and the effects of solar wind on our planet.

The United States declared its independence from Great Britain in 1776, as the thirteen British colonies on the Atlantic seaboard of North America broke away from Great Britain and formed a new nation, the United States of America. The U.S. Constitution was adopted in 1787, and the country was expanded with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and the annexation of Texas in 1845. The American Civil War was fought from 1861 to 1865, resulting in the abolition of slavery and the preservation of the Union. The country expanded further with the acquisition of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines in the late 19th century, and Hawaii in 1898. The U.S. emerged from World War II as a superpower, and the country's post-war economic expansion was marked by a period of rapid economic growth and global economic dominance. Today, the United States is the world's largest economy by nominal GDP, and the country is a leader in many fields, including technological innovation, entertainment, and military power.",

The BC system was developed by the monk Dionysius Exiguus in the 6th century. Prior to his work, there was no standardized system for dating years. Dionysius Exiguus developed the BC system as a way to count the years between the birth of Jesus Christ and the present day. The BC system is based on the traditionally accepted date of Jesus Christ's birth, which is believed to have occurred in 4 BC. However, there is some debate among scholars as to the exact date of Jesus' birth, and some believe that it may have occurred as much as several years earlier or later than 4 BC. The BC system is still widely used today, particularly in academic and historical contexts.
