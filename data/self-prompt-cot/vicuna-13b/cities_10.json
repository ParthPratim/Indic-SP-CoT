Tempura is believed to have been introduced to Japan in the late 16th century by Portuguese traders. However, it was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that tempura became a popular dish among the Japanese people. Today, tempura is a staple of Japanese cuisine and is enjoyed both in Japan and around the world. Tempura is typically made by dipping the seafood, vegetables, and mushrooms in a mixture of flour, eggs, and water, before coating them in a batter made from tempura flour and deep-frying them until crispy. The batter is thin and light, allowing the natural flavors of the seafood, vegetables, and mushrooms to shine through. Tempura is often served with a variety of side dishes, including pickled vegetables, grated daikon radish, and tempura sauce. It is also commonly served as a topping on ramen, udon, and soba noodles.
