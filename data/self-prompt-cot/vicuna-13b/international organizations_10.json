The EU operates on the principle of supranationalism, which means that decisions are made at the EU level rather than at the level of individual member states. This is achieved through a system of shared sovereignty, where member states agree to pool some of their powers together in order to achieve common goals.

The treaty established the European Union (EU) as a political union and a single market, and introduced the euro as a single currency. 4. The treaty also created the European Union's predecessor, the European Community, which was established in 1993 with the signing of the Maastricht Treaty. 5. The treaty was a significant step towards European integration and the creation of a single European market. 6. The treaty also established the European Council, which is made up of the heads of state or government of the member states, and the European Commission, which is the executive branch of the EU. 7. The treaty also includes provisions for the cooperation and coordination of foreign and security policy among member states. 8. The Maastricht Treaty has been amended several times since its signing, including the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, which made further changes to the EU's institutions and policies. 9. The treaty has been a subject of debate and criticism, with some arguing that it has led to a loss of national sovereignty and a concentration of power in the hands of a few. 10.
