            "passage": "Lion is a species of big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. The lion is a social cat and a pride can consist of up to 30 individuals. Males are typically larger than females with a typical weight range of 190 to 250 kg (420 to 550 lb) for males and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 400 lb) for females. Lions have a short tail and round ears. Their fur is usually tawny in color, but it varies from light to dark depending on the subspecies. Lions have a distinctive mane around their necks, which is typically thicker in males than in females. The mane is made up of thick fur that grows continuously and is maintained by grooming. Lions are apex predators and are capable of taking down large prey such as buffalo, wildebeest, and zebras. They are also known to scavenge on carrion. Lions are territorial and will defend their pride's territory from other prides. Lions are listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Their population has declined by about 43% over the past three decades, and they face threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Lions have played a significant role in the culture and mythology of many African tribes, and they are considered a symbol of strength, courage, and royalty. Lions are also a popular attraction in zoos and wildlife reserves around the world.",

Elephants are found in a range of habitats, including savannas, forests, and deserts, and are an important part of many cultures and ecosystems around the world. There are two main species of elephants: the African elephant and the Asian elephant. African elephants are larger than Asian elephants, with males weighing up to 6,000 kg (13,200 lb) and standing up to 3.3 m (11 ft) tall at the shoulder. Asian elephants, on the other hand, weigh up to 5,500 kg (12,000 lb) and stand up to 3 m (10 ft) tall at the shoulder. Both species have a gestation period of 22 months and give birth to one calf at a time. Elephants are highly social animals, living in complex societies led by older females. They communicate with each other through a range of vocalizations, body language, and chemical signals. Elephants have a highly developed brain, with a neocortex that is similar in size to that of humans and some other primates.

They are able to recognize individual members of their own species and even other species, such as humans. Zebras have been domesticated and used for their meat, milk, and as pack animals. However, their numbers have declined in the wild due to habitat loss and hunting. Conservation efforts are underway to protect zebra populations and their habitats. Zebras have been the subject of much scientific study, and researchers continue to learn more about their behavior, physiology, and ecology.

Kangaroos are herbivores and feed on a variety of plants, including grasses, shrubs, and trees. They have a unique digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from tough plant material. Kangaroos have a very efficient metabolism and can survive on very little food and water. Kangaroos have a gestation period of 30-36 days and give birth to a fully developed joey, which is only about the size of a jellybean. The joey spends the first few months of its life in a pouch on the mother's belly, where it receives milk and protection. After about six months, the joey begins to emerge from the pouch and starts to explore the world outside. Kangaroos have a number of adaptations that help them survive in their native Australian environment. Their powerful hind legs allow them to jump up to 30 feet (9 meters) in a single bound, which helps them evade predators and travel long distances. Their long, thick tail provides balance and helps them to maintain their balance while jumping. Kangaroos are also able to regulate their body temperature by sweating through their skin, which helps them to cope with the extreme temperatures in their environment.

There are 18 species of penguins, ranging from the tiny fairy penguin to the emperor penguin, which can grow up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall and weigh as much as 88 pounds (40 kilograms). Some species of penguins are highly adapted for living in the cold waters of the Southern Ocean, while others prefer the warmer waters of the equator. Penguins are social birds that typically live in large colonies. They have a distinctive waddling gait on land and are able to swim at speeds of up to 22 miles (35 kilometers) per hour. Penguins are also known for their unique vocalizations, which they use to communicate with each other. The most famous penguin is probably the king penguin, which is the second-largest species of penguin after the emperor penguin.
