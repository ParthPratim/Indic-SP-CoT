The championship has been held every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except for 1942 and 1946, due to World War II. The tournament consists of several stages, including qualifying rounds, and a final phase which is contested by 32 national teams. The host nation automatically qualifies, while the rest of the teams must go through a qualification process. The tournament is played in a knockout format, with each match decided by a single goal. Extra time and penalty shootouts are used to decide knockout matches if necessary. The tournament has been held in 24 different countries, with Brazil winning the most titles, five, and Italy and Germany winning four titles each. The most recent tournament was held in 2018, with the next one scheduled for 2022 in Qatar. The World Cup is the most-watched and most-followed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 3.5 billion viewers for the 2018 final. The tournament has also been marred by controversies, including match-fixing, doping, and corruption scandals. The World Cup has also been used as a platform for political and social issues, with boycotts and protests held by various countries and organizations over human rights abuses, political instability, and other concerns. In summary, the FIFA World Cup is a highly anticipated international football tournament that brings together the best national teams from around the world to compete for the title of world champions.",

Today, the competition involves 79 teams from 54 countries, and is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world. Format The Champions League begins with a qualifying round in July and August, where the 10 winners from the third qualifying round enter the group stage. The 32 teams are then drawn into eight groups of four, with each team playing six matches against the other teams in their group. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage, which begins in February of the following year. The knockout stage consists of two-legged ties, with the away goals rule used to determine the winner in the event of a draw. The quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final are all one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to determine the winner if the score is level after 90 minutes. Prize money The Champions League operates on a system of prize money, with the winners receiving €1.9 billion (£1.6 billion) in 2021. This is distributed among the participating teams based on their performance in the competition, with the winners receiving the largest share.

He is the only player to have won all four major championships in a single calendar year, accomplishing this feat in 1930. He is also known for his sportsmanship and his role in founding the Augusta National Golf Club. Jones was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and began playing golf at an early age. He quickly became a skilled player, and by the age of 16 had won his first tournament. He turned professional in 1927, but continued to play as an amateur, as he believed that the game should be played for the love of it rather than for financial gain. Jones's greatest achievement came in 1930, when he won all four major championships: the British Open, the U.S. Open, the U.S. Amateur, and the British Amateur. This feat has never been repeated, and is considered one of the greatest achievements in the history of golf. After retiring from competitive golf, Jones focused on promoting the game and teaching it to others. He founded the Bobby Jones Golf Course in Atlanta, and also worked as a golf course architect. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974. Jones was known for his sportsmanship and his commitment to the spirit of the game. He was known to call penalties on himself, and was respected by his fellow players for his honesty and integrity.",
