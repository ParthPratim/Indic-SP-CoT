The IMF has five principal roles:\n1. Provide liquidity to its members in crisis. 2. Facilitate the exchange of payments between its members. 3. Facilitate trade and payments by acting as a lender of last resort for its members. 4. Provide a forum for discussing economic issues. 5. Issue reserve assets to its members.
