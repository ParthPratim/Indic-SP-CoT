It was one of the largest species of ungulates ever to have existed and was a close relative of the aurochs, the extinct wild ancestor of domestic cattle. The aurochs was larger than its descendant but, as it became extinct, it was replaced by the larger domestic cattle, a process that was completed in historical times with the advent of modern farming practices. Cattle are the most common type of Bos primigenius. They are raised in large numbers for meat, milk, leather and other products, and are of great importance to humans. The living animal is often referred to as a \"cow\", a term also used for the adult female of other Bos species, or as a \"bull\", a male of the same species, or for other cattle. Cattle have been raised for food by humans for at least 10,000 years, and their remains have been found in archaeological sites in the Fertile Crescent and date as far back as the 10th millennium BC. Their remains have also been found in the Indus Valley Civilisation and in the Americas.",

Sheep are ruminants with four stomachs, consisting of the rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum. The first three chambers are fermentation chambers, used in the digestion of cellulose, and the last chamber is a true stomach that secretes enzymes that help to further digest the cellulose. There are more than 200 species of sheep, and they vary greatly in size and shape, depending on the species. Sheep are generally smaller than cattle, and their wool is usually longer, and coarser. The most common domesticated sheep breeds are the Dorset, the Hampshire, and the Suffolk, and the Southdown. Sheep have been raised by humans for at least 10,000 years and are one of the first animals to be selectively bred. The Merino is a breed of sheep that was developed in Spain in the 18th century, and is known for its fine wool. The Finnsheep is a breed of sheep that was developed in the early 20th century in Finland, and was the first breed of sheep to be developed in North America.
