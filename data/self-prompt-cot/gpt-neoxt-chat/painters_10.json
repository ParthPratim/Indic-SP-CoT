He is considered by some to be the father of modern art. His best-known series of work, the Water Lilies, are some of the most reproduced images in art history. He is often referred to as the \\\"father of impressionism\\\" or the \\\"father of post-impressionism\\\", although he himself rejected these labels. He was one of the first artists to abandon the detailed, carefully composed studio painting in favor of painting en plein air, or in the open air, and his later works are noted for their broken color and light effects. Monet is considered one of the most important and influential artists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is often ranked among the most important artists of the 19th century and one of the most influential artists of all time, and he is sometimes called the \"Leonardo of the 20th century\".",

He is considered one of the most influential figures in the development of 20th-century art. He was born in Zundert, in the southern province of North Brabant, as the son of a Protestant minister. Van Gogh moved to Amsterdam to study theology but was unable to accept a life of duty and discipline and was baptized a Roman Catholic in 1875. He worked as an art dealer and submitted paintings to art salons, but struggled to make a living. In 1886, he moved to the village of Nuenen, where he was inspired by the surrounding countryside to produce some of his most memorable works. He suffered from mental illness throughout his life, and died in 1890, aged 37, following a gunshot wound inflicted by his friend and fellow artist, painter Paul Gauguin. Van Gogh's work had little impact during his lifetime, but in the years following his death, he became widely admired. His reputation has grown steadily since the late 20th century and he is now widely regarded as one of the most significant figures in the history of art, and one of the most popular and influential painters of all time. He was an extremely prolific artist, completing about 2,200 paintings in his lifetime. He left behind about 1,800 paintings and 800 drawings.",
