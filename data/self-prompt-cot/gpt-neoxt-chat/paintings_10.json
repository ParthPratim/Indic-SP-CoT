It was painted around 1434, and is housed in the National Gallery in London. The sitter is identified as Giovanna da Piacenza, the wife of Giovanni di Niccolò Arnolfini. It is the only known oil painting of a Northern European woman from the early 15th century. The painting was commissioned by Giovanni di Niccolò Arnolfini (1400-1464), a wealthy silk merchant from Lucca, who had married into a wealthy Florentine family. The couple lived in the prosperous Dutch city of Bruges, which was an important trading centre and the largest city in Flanders. The Arnolfini were among the most prominent members of their community, and were friends with the leading artists of the day. The painting was probably completed in 1434, shortly after the marriage. The painting was probably the culmination of a commission by the Arnolfinis. The Arnolfinis were prosperous members of the Bruges art world, and the painting was likely a gift for Giovanni's brother Giacomo, who was a successful goldsmith.",

            "passage": "The Murder of Gonzago is a painting by Peter Paul Rubens, completed between 1607 and 1610 and now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. It is one of the masterpieces of the artist's early Baroque style. It was commissioned by the Duke of Lerma, and is thought to have been intended to be hung in his house in Aranjuez. It shows the murder of Gonzago, a Moor by the name of Gonzalo Guerrero, who was beheaded in 1591 by the Spanish Inquisition for the crime of heresy. The painting is one of the first examples of a Baroque tondo, a circular painting that depicts a scene in an interior, and is a forerunner to the trompe l'oeil paintings of the 17th century. The work shows Gonzalo Guerrero being beheaded by a sword, while his wife kneels in despair, holding their dead child. A dog looks on, as if it were the only witness. The painting was commissioned by the Duke of Lerma, and is thought to have been intended to be hung in his house in Aranjuez. It is one of Rubens's most famous paintings, and is considered one of his masterpieces. It was first recorded in the collection of the Duke of Lerma in 1703, but it is not certain that the work was the one commissioned by the duke.",

The statue is one of the most famous works of sculpture in the world. The original statue, commissioned by Louis XIV of France for the Palace of Versailles, was placed in the center of a round reflecting pool in the main courtyard of the palace. The fountain was designed by the French architect André Le Nôtre. The statue is made of travertine marble. In 1682, Louis XIV had the statue removed from the fountain and placed in a small room in the palace. He had the room lined with red velvet and had a small desk placed in front of it. He would sit in the room and contemplate, while holding court from behind the desk. The room was called the Cabinet du Roi (\"King's Cabinet\"). The room was used in this way until 1698 when Louis XIV had it moved to the Palace of Fontainebleau. There it was placed in front of the King's bedchamber. The room was redecorated in the rococo style. In 1752, the statue was removed from the room and placed in a gallery at the Palace of Versailles.",
