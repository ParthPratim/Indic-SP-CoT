Alliums are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but many have been introduced to other parts of the world, and many species are grown as ornamental plants. They are also grown for their edible bulbous underground storage organs, which are sometimes called \"onions\" in the culinary tradition. The most widely known species is the common onion, which is a domesticated variety of the related wild species Allium cepa. The genus name \"Allium\" comes from the Ancient Greek word for garlic, <ελ-λεις>. The name \"Allium\" was first used by Carl von Linné to cover the genus, and was later extended by Joseph Gaertner to include the closely related genus \"Nepeta\". The common name \"onion\" for Allium cepa is thought to have originated as a diminutive of the Latin word <unio> (\"union\"), which was a common name for the bulb.",

Aloe species are often used in traditional medicine, and many species have potential as a source of biofuel. Aloes vary in size from diminutive, creeping plants to large, erect species. They have fleshy leaves with sharp-pointed edges, arranged in rosettes or dense clusters. They are often covered with a white powder, composed of silica, that gives them their characteristic feel and appearance. The leaves contain a viscous gel that is yellow to orange in color. The gel is made up mostly of water-soluble aliphatic compounds known as aloins, of which the most common are aloin A and B. Other substances found in the gel include anthranoids, such as ascorbigen, and various unidentified flavonoid compounds. The species of Aloe vary considerably in appearance, with many exhibiting considerable variation in leaf size, shape and color. The leaves are usually thick and fleshy, and range in size from a few millimetres to over a metre.",

The flowers grow in a circle around the stem. They are bell-shaped and white to pink in colour, and have a sweet fragrance. The sepals and petals are joined together at the base to form a tube. The tube narrows into the upper part of the flower, where the petals are joined into a hood or \"galea\", and the lower part is the \"carpophore\", which bears the stigma.
