More than nine million soldiers, sailors, and airmen, along with over five million civilians, died as a result of the conflict, which is also considered the deadliest war in history. The war was the result of a long period of military, social, and diplomatic tensions between the European great powers before 1914, as well as conflicts between nationalists and imperialists in many other nations. It is also considered a war of choice for Germany and Austria-Hungary, who were hoping to use the conflict as an opportunity to win a war against Russia and France, respectively, as well as knock Russia out of the ongoing conflict in the Caucasus. The war was characterized by mass mobilisation of troops, economic blockades of enemy nations, and trench warfare on the Western Front, culminating in a military stalemate. It was also marked by revolutionary changes in military tactics and technology, including the development of the airplane and the tank. The war drew in all the world’s great powers, which were soon bogged down in a conflict that they were unable to win. The fighting ended with a defeat for the Central Powers, who sued for peace in 1918, and with an armistice for the Allies.",

It involved the vast majority of the world's nations—including all of the great power empires of the time—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \"total war\", the major participants in the war mobilized their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities to fight it. The conflict led to the deaths of around 50 million people, including around 17 million military personnel. It is also considered the deadliest war in human history, with estimates of the total death toll ranging from 40 to 80 million people, and is one of only two conflicts to have been ranked as the deadliest ever, the other one being the Mongol conquest of the Middle East in the 13th century. World War II can also refer to the era between the end of the conflict and the start of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union and the United States emerged as the two superpowers.

The war started as a result of the secession of eleven states from the United States following the 1860 presidential election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln.

Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and James \"P.B.\" Forrest. The war resulted in the effective dissolution of the United States as an independent nation, with the formation of the United States of America and the Confederate States of America. The American Civil War was caused by the irreconcilable difference between the North and the South over the institution of slavery and the expansion of slavery into the western territories.

The transition began in the textile industry and then spread to other industries. It was characterized by a dramatic acceleration in technological innovation, and by the widespread adoption of industrial processes and factory machinery, such as the steam engine, spinning jenny, and power loom. The term \"Industrial Revolution\" is often used as a shorthand for the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. However, there were significant technological and social changes that began in the late 17th century and continued into the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain and then spread to continental Europe and later to North America and Japan. The mechanization of agriculture, the development of new metalworking technologies, and the growth of urban centers were important aspects of the revolution. The period saw a dramatic increase in economic growth and a significant decrease in the price of products, leading to increased consumer wealth and new classes of consumers. The Industrial Revolution began as a response to market forces and the scarcity of skilled labor. The development of machines to replace manual labor was spurred by the Enclosure Acts, which reduced the amount of open land available for grazing and made it profitable for farmers to invest in labor-saving machines.",

It was the culmination of a long period of political and economic upheaval in Russia, during which the country had been in the process of moving away from an agrarian, pre-industrialized economy towards an urban, industrialized society. The Russian Revolution also marked the defeat of Tsarism and the end of 3 centuries of Romanov rule. The immediate cause of the Revolution was Russia's involvement in World War I. Russia had been one of the Great Powers since its defeat of Napoleon in 1815, but it was not prepared for a modern war. The war and its disastrous effects on the economy, combined with political turmoil and the poor leadership of Tsar Nicholas II, led to the Revolution. In the words of historian Richard Pipes, \"the Revolution was the work of a coalition of diverse groups, but it was the common people who did the fighting\".

Hitler and the Nazis pursued an aggressive foreign policy, starting with the remilitarization of the Rhineland and the annexation of Austria in March 1938 and the Sudetenland in September 1938. The remilitarization of the Rhineland violated the Treaty of Versailles, which had ended World War I and had required Germany to withdraw its troops from the Rhineland. In March 1939, Germany annexed the largely ethnically-German Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia. The annexation was a violation of the Munich Agreement, in which Britain, France, and Italy had promised to protect the Czechs if Germany invaded.

He is considered one of the most successful military commanders in history, and his reign is often referred to as the \"Age of Napoleon\". After a series of victories on the battlefield, Napoleon took control of France and much of the surrounding territory, and ruled as a military dictator. He created a new political structure called the Consulate, and held a series of political meetings with other European leaders known as the Congress of Vienna. He integrated new technology and ideas into the military, and expanded the size of the army. He reorganized the government bureaucracy, and created a new system of education that emphasized the values of the Revolution. He pursued an expansionist foreign policy that aimed to challenge the British Empire and the Russian Empire, but was defeated in the War of 1812, and later the conflict with Russia became a personal vendetta.
