His parents were both descended from Jewish families that had converted to Christianity. Einstein grew up in Munich and, after his father's early death, lived with his maternal grandfather, Hermann Koch, and grandmother, Pauline Koch. His parents were both from farming families, and Hermann was an unsuccessful pharmacist who had hoped to become a doctor. Einstein was a slow, sickly and dreamy child, and was largely homeschooled by his mother. At the age of 16 he developed a near fatal infection of the bone marrow (pernicious anaemia), which he credited as a turning point in his intellectual development: \"Everything that happened after that, even the seemingly insignificant, took on new aspects for me, as if it were all part of a cosmic order.\" In 1895 Einstein enrolled in the University of Zurich to study theoretical physics, but he found the courses too difficult and switched to a degree program that would allow him to specialize in math and physics. He received his doctorate in 1905. He was a shy, awkward, and unkempt figure, and had a halting and difficult-to-follow speaking style that led to his nickname of \"the professor\", which he disliked.",

He was the first to describe the principles of inheritance, showing that discrete units of inheritance are passed from parent to offspring. He is also credited with establishing the discipline of genetics as a science. Born to a family of farmers near Brno in Moravia, then part of the Austrian Empire, Mendel was educated by the Benedictine Order. He became a monk at the Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno, where he taught classes in physics and mathematics. In 1856, he published his findings on experiments using garden peas, which had been bred for various traits for centuries, and showed that each character was determined by two factors, one from each parent. He called these factors \"elements\" or \"germ plasm\" (today, \"gene\"). He also showed that these elements could combine in pairs to create the various combinations of traits that were seen in the peas. He published his findings in a paper entitled Experiments on Plant Hybrids, in the Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn, in 1857. Mendel's work went largely unnoticed until the early 20th century, when his ideas were rediscovered and expanded upon by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns, independently.",

Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, to a wealthy family who had strong interests in natural sciences. He was a sickly child with little formal education. He spent much time outdoors, learning about nature and observing animals and plants, particularly after inheriting a large house with a garden in 1825. He became fascinated with the power of natural selection and the idea that it had led to the diversity of life on Earth. In 1831 he joined the HMS Beagle as a naturalist, and began to study the geology and biology of South America and the Galapagos Islands. He returned to Britain in 1836 and began to write up his observations, but finding it difficult to publish his ideas, delayed doing so for another ten years. In 1844 he began to publish, with the publication of his book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which sold out in a few weeks. He followed this with other publications, and spent the rest of his life attempting to defend his theory and explain the evidence he had collected. He spent his last years in Kent, where he died.",

He is best known for his wartime work cracking the German Enigma code, for which he was later prosecuted and convicted of \"gross indecency\" and sentenced to chemical castration. Turing's work during the war has been called \"the single most influential event in the history of the modern computer\" and \"the single biggest contribution to the Allied victory in World War II\". In 1937, Turing was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and he delivered its Croonian Lecture in 1941 on \"Contributions to the Theory of Final Values\". He was appointed a professor at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, where he worked on machine learning, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1943. Turing's work on the design of a universal computer, and his theoretical description of a stored-program computer, were recognised with the British Royal Society's Adams Prize in 1949, and he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1952. However, his work on artificial intelligence has been criticised as \"premature\" and his proposed \"Turing test\" for machine intelligence has been criticised as being too narrow to be a meaningful measure of \"true\" intelligence. In 1952, Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory in England, where he designed an early computer.",

He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, the long-lasting alkaline battery, and the electric light bulb. He founded the world's first industrial research laboratory, which later became the General Electric Company. He was also the first to demonstrate commercially viable electric power generation and distribution. Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, to Samuel and Nancy Elliott Edison, the eighth of nine children. He was an inquisitive child, and by his own admission, he did not learn much at school, but he excelled at tinkering and making things with his hands. At the age of nine, his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, where he attended public school. At the age of 16, he went to work for his brother, a country store owner, as a bookkeeper, and he later became an agent for a telegraph company. In 1869, Edison moved to Boston, where he worked for two years in a telegraph company. He then moved to New York City and worked as an agent for a railroad telegraph company, where he was promoted to chief operator.",

Darwin's theory replaced the previously dominant view of \"creationism\" and \"intelligent design\", and is the predominant view in modern biology. He also made significant contributions to the fields of botany, zoology, and geology. Darwin's early life and education provided little direction for his future scientific work, although his childhood experiences left a lasting impression on him. He spent much of his time outdoors and was interested in observing and collecting animals, plants, and minerals. His observations and experiments as a child and teenager left an indelible impression on his thought and work. Darwin's early work in geology led him to be selected as the naturalist on the survey ship HMS Beagle, during which time he collected specimens and made observations that laid the foundations of his future work. His five-year circumnavigation of the globe, and the resulting collection of biological and geological samples, convinced him of the power of natural selection to produce new biological species. He later recalled, \"It is like looking back 10,000 years and thinking of all the stages of man's progression\".",

He was the first to propose that electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom and that the energy of the emitted radiation is equal to the frequency of their orbital motion. Bohr received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922 for his explanation of the structure of atoms and molecules in terms of electron orbits and for the discovery of the phenomenon of radioactivity, which he called the \"Bohr model\" of the atom.",

Elizabeth was born in London as the second child and daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen consort Elizabeth), and is also a great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria. At the time of her birth, two of her grandfather's cousins, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Prince Edward, Duke of York, held the position of heir apparent to the throne. Her father, the Duke of York, inherited his father's title in 1901, and became the second monarch of the newly created Kingdom of England (now the United Kingdom) on his accession in 1936. The House of Windsor is the oldest extant continuous royal family in the world and the largest royal family of Europe by both number of members and territory; it has also reigned as the kings and queens of Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. The royal family's wealth, however, is not derived from any of those realms, but from the British monarchy, which is among the largest and wealthiest monarchies in the world. Elizabeth is the oldest and longest-reigning monarch of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms.",
