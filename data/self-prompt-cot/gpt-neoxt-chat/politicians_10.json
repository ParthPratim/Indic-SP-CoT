Her selection marked the first time a Republican had nominated a woman for the office. Palin's selection as McCain's running mate was controversial, as she was little known outside Alaska. Born to a career U.S. Coast Guard officer and a stay-at-home mom, Palin grew up in the small town of Sandpoint, Idaho. After graduating from high school, she attended the University of Idaho in Moscow for two years. In 1986, she moved to Alaska to work as a commercial fisherman's aide. Palin was first elected mayor of Wasilla in 1996. During her tenure, the city government was reorganized and consolidated. She was elected governor of Alaska in 2006 and re-elected in 2010. Palin's tenure as governor was marked by controversy and criticism, including a number of ethics complaints filed against her. In her 2010 campaign for a second term, she was defeated by Democrat Mark Begich.
