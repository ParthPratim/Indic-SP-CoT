It is a key concept in the social psychology of Pierre Bourdieu and is also central to the work of Erving Goffman. Social identification is a key concept in the work on the social psychology of Henri Tajfel, who proposed the minimal-group paradigm. It is also used in the social identity model of collective behavior, which explains group behavior and intergroup relations. Social identification is used in social learning theory, a social psychological theory of learning that explains how people learn the norms, values and behaviors of their group. It is also used in self-categorization theory, which is a social psychological theory that explains how individuals form their self-concepts by categorizing themselves into groups. Social identification is also used in the social identity approach to cognition and the self, which is a psychological approach that proposes that the self is a social category.",
