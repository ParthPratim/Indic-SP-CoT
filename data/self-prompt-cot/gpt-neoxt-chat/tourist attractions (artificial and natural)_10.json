The waterfall is named after the pilot of the first airplane to fly over its summit, Charles Edward Fay, who had a vision of the Virgin Mary there, hence the name \"Angel\". The waterfall is the highest uninterrupted vertical fall and the highest free-falling waterfall in the world, dropping a total of 778 m (2,549 ft) from the Pico Puncu (3,050 m; 9,900 ft) to the Pico Raza (2,700 m; 9,000 ft), with an average descent speed of 1,212 m/minute (3,950 ft/minute). The volume of water is estimated to be between 3,000 and 5,000 m3 (200 and 300 million US gal) per second. The Angel Falls, which are formed by the convergence of the Ríos Caroní and Yapacana, have a total drop of 3,212 m (10,500 ft), and are the world's second highest waterfall.",

The church was constructed during the reign of Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), and named in his honor. It was built in the form of a cross, with a dome over the eastern arm and a smaller dome over the southern arm. The building was encircled by two rows of columns, and had three main doors, one in the western façade, one in the northern, and the other one in the southern façade. The church was converted into a mosque during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror (r. 1451–1481) and renamed \"Hagia Sophia\". It was later converted into a museum and currently houses the İç Kale (Inner Palace) of the Turkish Presidential Palace. The building is considered one of the finest examples of Byzantine architecture and is a World Heritage Site.

Uluru, which has a number of local Aboriginal names (such as Ayers Rock and Kata Tjuta), is a prominent landmark in the area, and has long been considered sacred by the local indigenous people. It is often described as the most prominent feature in the Outback and is a common symbol of the Australian Outback, while the nearby town of Alice Springs takes its name from its proximity to the rock. Uluru rises dramatically above the surrounding plain, and is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Australia, depicted on the country's coat of arms. The traditional owners of Uluru, the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara peoples, have had joint management of the site since 1985. Uluru is a monolith composed of alternating layers of hard and softer rock. The top of the rock is flat and measures 2.4 km (1.5 mi) by 1.8 km (1.1 mi).
