It is bordered by Turkey to the west, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh to the north, Georgia to the northeast, and Iran and Azerbaijan to the east. The territory of modern-day Armenia has been inhabited by humans since at least 10,000 BC. The area was first unified by the ancient Kingdom of Armenia between c. 4th and 6th centuries AD. The ancient Armenian kingdom fell to Arab Muslims in the 7th century, then ruled by the Bagratid and Karsid rulers, and by the Mongol Empire in the 13th-15th centuries. Following the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917 and subsequent collapse of the Russian Caucasus Army in 1918, the First Republic of Armenia was proclaimed. Between 1918 and 1920, the state fought against invading forces from the west and the east. It was subsequently partitioned by the neighboring countries, with the western part becoming a sovereign country, the Republic of Turkey.",

Borges' writings, which include more than thirty books, have been translated into many languages and have attained iconic status in the Spanish-speaking world. He was nominated for the International Prize for Arabic Literatur e and the Jerusalem Prize. He was described as \"the greatest literary figure in the Spanish-speaking world\" by Harold Bloom. Borges began his literary career as a poet but is best known for his short stories, including \"The Garden of Forking Paths\", which blend fantasy and reality in literary works that are often labyrinthine and play on the borderlines of literature. His other works include the essays \"The Aleph\" and \"A New Refutation of Time\". Borges also wrote poetry, which has been compared to that of Walt Whitman and William Carlos Williams.
