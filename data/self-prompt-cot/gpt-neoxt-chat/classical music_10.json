He is widely considered one of the greatest composers of all time. Bach's compositions, including over 1000 sacred cantatas, many of which are still regularly performed, and four large-scale sacred Passions, have exerted an incalculable influence on composers and musicians, of which the most famous example is his younger contemporary, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who called Bach \"the father of music\". Bach was born in Eisenach and, after showing early promise as a performer, studied theology and law at the University of Erfurt, before taking a position as a court musician in Weimar in 1707. In 1723 he was appointed director of church music and court chaplain in Leipzig, where he remained until his death in 1750. He composed extensively for the church year and the liturgical year, including many motets, Latin psalms, cantatas, and Passions. His music is widely heard on the organ and in the chamber and concerto repertoire. He was also an important figure in the development of the violin and violoncello, and was an influential teacher to many of the leading musicians of his era.",

The family lived on the rue d'Anjou in Paris, in a house that had been built by Berlioz's grandfather, and that was later inherited by Berlioz's brother, Émile. Berlioz's father died in 1803, when he was only five years old. The family was then left in difficult financial circumstances. Berlioz was brought up largely by his maternal grandfather and his unmarried, elderly maiden sister. He was educated at home by private tutors. Berlioz's first music teachers were the organist and composer Jean-Louis Duport and the composer and singing teacher Jean-François Lesueur. He also studied the violin and piano, but his musical interests were mainly focused on the organ and on music theory. In his late teens, Berlioz became acquainted with the leading Romantic musicians of the day, and became a friend of the composer Hector Berlioz, the writer Théophile Gautier and the artist Édouard Manet.",
