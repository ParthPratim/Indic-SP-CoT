The island was called Ikongo (meaning \"great island\" or \"big island\") by its earliest settlers. The name \"Madagascar\" comes from the Malagasy language, and means \"land of the great kings\" (from the words mada, \"king\" and iko, \"land\"). In the 16th century, the island was colonized by the Portuguese, who established a permanent settlement in the northern port of Sofala. The island was later colonized by the East India Company and became part of the British Empire.
