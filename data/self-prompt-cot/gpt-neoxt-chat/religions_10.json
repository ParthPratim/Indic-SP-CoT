Although the term Buddhism is commonly taken to refer to these various traditions, it is in fact only one of them; the others being the closely related but distinct Dharma teachings of Hinduism and Jainism. The term Buddhism is derived from the Sanskrit word buddh, meaning \"to awaken\" or \"to become aware\", and refers to the personal experience of awakening, liberation, or release that occurs when this awareness arises. The term \"Buddhism\" thus denotes the teachings of those who have claimed to have awoken from the various stages of \"delusion\" (avidya) to the ultimate nature of \"awakening\" (bodhi). The teachings of the Buddha are preserved in various early and classical Buddhist texts, which generally take the form of dialogues, sermons, and monastic rules. Buddha, meaning \"awakened\" or \"enlightened\", was the name given to the founder of Buddhism. In early Buddhism, Gautama Buddha was regarded as the supreme being who was born into the Shakya clan in Lumbini Garden in the eastern part of Nepal. He is believed to have lived and taught in the northeastern region of India sometime between the sixth and fourth centuries BCE.",

Christians believe that Jesus is the \"Word of God\" and the \"Messiah\" prophesied in the Hebrew Bible, and that his death and resurrection has saved humanity from the consequences of sin. Christianity has its roots in Judaism, and the majority of Jews today are affiliated with the religion of Christianity. Christianity has influenced many other religions, cultures, ideas, and institutions, both positively and negatively. The beliefs and practices of the various churches and denominations are diverse, and range from the historically orthodox to the liberal.

Jainism is an ascetic tradition and the oldest extant Indian religion, with an ascetic tradition that originated in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE and has survived in India since then, with a decline in the number of adherents. Jainism is a nontheistic religion, meaning that it does not believe in a personal creator God, and its followers are called Jains. The Jain tradition has survived as an ascetic tradition, with a small number of followers. The religion has a significant following in the Indian state and overseas Jain diaspora. The religion's sacred texts, the \"Agamas\" or \"Pravachans\", date back to the 1st millennium BCE, but the earliest available texts were written in the 1st or 2nd century CE.",

It is the indigenous religion of Japan, and the spiritual foundation of Japanese culture. Shinto is based on the worship and veneration of the kami, which are the forces that the Shinto religion considers animating everything in the universe. The kami are not considered to be transcendent beings but rather to be the presence and essence of the sacred in the natural world and the objects therein. Shinto is sometimes called the \"Way of the gods\" (Kami no Michi). Shinto shrines, which serve as the religious centers of the faith, are called \"jingū\" (神宮) in Japanese. The kami are believed to have the ability to manifest themselves to the world, and the faith is thus strongly tied to practices of ritual purification and offerings. The faith is also characterized by a strong sense of reverence for nature and a belief in the spiritual potential of objects. Shinto is sometimes considered a polytheistic or nature-worshipping faith; however, it also has aspects that are similar to monotheistic religions such as the veneration of ancestors and a belief in an otherworldly paradise, as well as a belief in kami as the ultimate divine beings.",
