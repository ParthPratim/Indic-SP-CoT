Britain had imposed a number of acts that led to colonists' resentment of British authority and taxation without representation in Parliament. The Thirteen Colonies were British America's most populated and economically important colonies. They were led by a Continental Congress representing the Second Continental Congress. The war began in April 1775, when the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, stating that \\\"these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states\\\", and authorized the First Continental Congress to appoint George Washington to be Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. Britain had attempted to assert authority over the colonies in 1774 with the Coercive Acts, but colonists had refused to comply. When open fighting began in 1775, the American Revolutionary War had begun, and by 1776 the American Revolutionary War was underway. The war began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The battles were fought on April 19 and April 19 (sources vary), 1775, respectively. Colonists in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, unhappy over the heavy taxes imposed by Britain and their inability to participate in government, had been stockpiling weapons for some time.",

The war resulted in the abolition of slavery in the United States, the re-integration of the Confederate states into the Union, and the end of the slaveholding culture in the South. The principal cause of the war was the division of the U.S. Constitution's balance of power between the federal government and the states. The war was fought primarily between the states of the North and those of the South. The American Civil War was preceded by the 1850s, a decade of economic boom and high tensions. The South's growing dependence on slavery as an economic mainstay, the perceived threat of slave uprisings and the federal government's growing power under the fugitive slave clause led to the election of Abraham Lincoln and other anti-slavery Republicans to the U.S. Congress in the mid-term elections of 1862. The Republicans, led by President Lincoln, passed the Homestead Act, the Morrill Land Grant Act, the Pacific Railway Act and the National Bank Act. The South, led by Jefferson Davis of the Confederate States of America, opposed any expansion of slavery and secession, and formed the Confederate States of America.",

The Paraguayans were trying to extend their territory and influence into the Chaco, a region that had been largely ignored by the central government. The war was fought between the Paraguayan army and Bolivian army. The Paraguayan army was defeated by the Bolivian army in the Battle of Cañada Strongest in 1880. The war continued for two more years until a peace treaty was signed in 1884, in which Bolivia recognized Paraguay's sovereignty over the Chaco and Paraguay ceded the Mato Grosso to Bolivia. The war had a significant effect on the region. The Chaco region was largely ignored by the Paraguayan government, who were more interested in the fertile land in the center of the country. The war led to a large emigration from the Chaco region, as many people fled the conflict.",

Lincoln was the first U.S. President from the former American South, the only President to have served in the American Civil War, and the first to have been elected to a second term. Born and raised in a frontier cabin, Lincoln developed an affinity for stories and debates while working in the fields. He became an apprentice storekeeper and then a partner in a general store, a flatboatman on the Mississippi River, a clerk in a general store, a postmaster, a surveyor and an elected official. In 1834, Lincoln settled in Illinois and began a law career, gaining election to the Illinois House of Representatives. In 1846, he challenged Senator Stephen A. Douglas in a celebrated series of debates, and was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He served in the House for 16 terms, and became the leader of the Whig Party. In 1860, Lincoln won the Republican Party's nomination for the presidency, and campaigned against the expansion of slavery. After winning the presidency in the 1860 election, Lincoln worked with the Congress to pass the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which ended slavery throughout the United States. He faced major challenges during his presidency, including the secession of several Southern states and the early stages of the American Civil War.",
