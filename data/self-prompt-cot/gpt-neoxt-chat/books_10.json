He spends his days wandering around New York City and dealing with various people he encounters, including the wealthy, spoiled Phoebe and her brother, Phineas. Holden is an unreliable narrator, and the reader is not privy to his innermost thoughts and feelings, but is given glimpses into the thoughts and feelings of others. Holden is a confused and cynical youth, but is also lonely and searching for a place to belong. He is constantly being ridiculed by the adults he encounters, including his parents, and is constantly trying, but failing, to escape from the world around him. The story follows Holden from his first day of summer vacation to his return to school in late September. The novel is narrated in the present tense as an adult looking back on the events of Holden's adolescence, but it is written in a style that is reminiscent of a diary. The novel's title comes from the nickname of a catcher on a baseball team, who is responsible for calling pitches to the batter and for throwing out base runners.",

The animals start by overthrowing Jones and his work-consisting-of-feeding-the-pigs attitude, and establish an egalitarian society in which all the animals are equal and free. The pigs, who are the smartest animals, take over this society and start to oppress the other animals in order to maintain their status. The animals, led by the barn-owl, rebel against the pigs and their new society, and return to the ideals of Jones. The animals re-establish Jones' work-consisting-of-feeding-the-pigs attitude, but with the addition of some work-consisting-of-rearing-the-pigs attitude. The animals establish a system of \"Animal Farm\", in which they all share equally and work together.

Set in the year 2540, it describes a utopian society in which the polar ice caps have melted, and the world is in a state of perpetual ecological crisis. The story is told from the point of view of the Savage, a character who has spent his childhood in the wilderness, but is educated and cultured enough to converse with the other main characters. The novel satirizes the ideas of progress and rationalism popularized by Victorian England. Huxley was among the most prominent intellectuals of the 1920s and 30s, but Brave New World was rejected by his literary contemporaries. It was published serially in a magazine, and when it was finally published in book form in 1932, it received mixed reviews. The book's reputation grew over time, and by the 1960s, it had become widely accepted as one of the great 20th-century works of literature. It has been adapted for film, television, and theater, and is widely considered a classic of the genre of utopian and dystopian fiction. The novel's themes of conformity, hedonism, and passivity have been the subject of extensive critical analysis.
