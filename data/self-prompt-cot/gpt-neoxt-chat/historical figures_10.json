He is best known for his philosophical works, particularly the \"Metaphysics\", \"Nicomachean Ethics\", and \"Rhetoric\", all of which have had significant influence on Western philosophy and science. Born on 384 BC on the Greek island of Stageira to a prominent family, Aristotle was orphaned at age eight and raised by his grandfather, who had been a student of Plato. At the age of seventeen he joined Plato's Academy in Athens, where he studied under such prominent scholars as Eudoxus of Cnidus and Speusippus, and became Plato's most prominent student and successor. Aristotle traveled widely and wrote over one hundred and fifty works, including treatises on biology, zoology, meteorology, mineralogy, logic, and physics, as well as books on poetry, rhetoric, and ethics. In the words of his biographer, \"Aristotle was the master of those who came after him, the founder of a school that dominated the teaching of philosophy down to the Middle Ages, and the author of books that were studied more than two thousand years after his death.\"",

His theory, known as \"the doctrine of original sin\", was a key element in the development of Western Christianity. Augustine was born in 354 in Tagaste, a small town in what is today Algeria. His father, Patricius, was a Roman citizen of Berber origin, and his mother, Saint Monica, was of Italian descent. His parents were devout Christians, and they taught him to speak Latin, the language of the Roman Empire, at an early age. He was baptized as a baby and grew up speaking both Latin and Greek. In 386, Augustine moved to Carthage, where, at the age of twenty, he became a Manichean. In the summer of 386, Augustine had a vision in his garden that he described as \"a light from heaven\". He converted to Catholicism and, in 387, he was ordained a deacon. He was later ordained a priest. Augustine was elected bishop of Hippo Regius, a position he occupied from 395 to his death in 430. He is considered one of the most significant and influential Christian theologians and philosophers in the history of the Catholic Church.

His mother's name was Felicity, and he had a younger brother named Florentius. In the year 500, he was invited to become the Abbot of the monastery of Subiaco by its then abbot, Evagrius. The monastery was located on the side of a mountain, and was in a state of disrepair. Benedict rebuilt the monastery, and in so doing, established a monastic order. The rule he developed, which was later called the Benedictine Rule, became the model for Western monasticism. The Benedictine Order spread throughout Western Europe and beyond, and the monasteries founded in his name became centers of learning and culture. He died in the year 549 at the monastery of Subiaco.

The Consolation of Philosophy is an ancient work of literature, written in Latin hexameters. It is divided into five books, and is written in the form of a letter from the imprisoned Boethius to his friend, the Roman senator Symmachus, who was also imprisoned at the time. In the Consolation, Boethius seeks to console himself and his family for their loss, and to explain his own philosophy of the Consolation of Philosophy, which is based on the works of Aristotle and Cicero. The Consolation of Philosophy has had an immense influence on Western literature and culture, and has inspired many works of literature and philosophy since its original writing. It is considered a key work of medieval literature and philosophy, and one of the most important works of Latin literature. Boethius was born around 480 in Rome, into an ancient family of the Roman nobility.

In the Hebrew Bible, David is the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah, and the fourth king of Israel, after Saul, Solomon, and Jeroboam. In the Book of Kings, he is a major character, but the Book of Chronicles, which covers the same events, focuses on him more. He was a warrior and leader who established Jerusalem as the capital of the united monarchy, and he defeated the Philistines, the Moabites, Edomites, and Ammonites. His reign is considered a golden age in the Hebrew Bible, with the building of Jerusalem's First Temple, the establishment of the city's fortifications, and the unification of the Israelites under a single monarchy. David is also a major character and the central figure in the Hebrew Bible's Book of Samuel. He is a young man from Bethlehem in Judah.

Francis was apprenticed to a cloth merchant but gave that up when he joined the Order of Saint Clare. He was soon joined by others who felt called to a religious life. Francis and his followers took a vow to live in poverty and chastity, and to go out to preach the Gospel. They soon attracted followers. Francis and his followers lived a simple life, wearing the clothes they had received from God. Francis preached the Gospel, and his sermons and writings are among the Franciscan treasures.

The Senate, a body of old and distinguished men, advised the consuls on the administration of the state. The Roman Republic was founded in 509 BC after the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic. The founding of the republic was preceded by centuries of political development and many previous attempts to create a republic, dating back to the early days of the Roman Kingdom. The Roman Republic was originally dominated by a wealthy and powerful senatorial class of aristocratic families, which was in control of the executive and judicial branches of the Roman state. Over time, this led to a concentration of power in the senatorial class, which was perceived as a threat to the democratic nature of the Roman state. This led to a series of civil wars between the Roman aristocracy and the plebeians, culminating in the conflict known as the Roman Revolution, in which the Roman Republic was replaced by the Roman Empire, ruled by a monarchical Emperor and his successors.",

It was founded during the Spring and Autumn Period (722–476 BCE) and the Warring States Period (475–221 BCE) of ancient Chinese history. Confucianism is sometimes called the \"School of Virtues\" or the \"School of Humanity\" (Chinese: Rén 仁 \"humanity\").",
