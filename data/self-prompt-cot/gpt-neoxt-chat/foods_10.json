Cultivars are sometimes distinguished as \"apples\" and other times as simply \"varieties\". The distinction between \"apple\" and \"variety\" is not consistent in the horticultural trade, and many apple cultivars are often referred to by their cultivar names, rather than their common names (e.g., 'Granny Smith'). There are thousands of cultivars of apples, and many of these have become common names for the apple, even though the cultivar name may be more familiar to some. For example, the 'Red Delicious' cultivar of apples is the most widely grown in North America and Europe, and is commonly called \"Delicious\" or \"Red Delicious\".",

The wild ancestors of bananas are a dioecious flowering plant native to the tropical forests of southeast Asia, with a wide range of variation in morphology and ecology. Banana domestication probably began independently in Southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea around 10,000 years ago, from the common ancestor of Musa Acuminata and M. balbisiana. The earliest archaeological evidence of banana cultivation is from Papua New Guinea, where banana heart-shaped leaf-scars have been found on pottery dating from around 5,000 years ago. The oldest archaeological specimens of the banana plant are two fruit stones from the Philippines, dated to around 3,500 years ago.

The plants are hardy in zones 5–9, but they can tolerate temperatures as low as −29 °C (−20 °F). The plant has a high tolerance to soil salinity. It is susceptible to fusarium wilt and downy mildew, which can be combatted with appropriate crop management practices. Broccoli is an important vegetable crop grown for its edible stalk and florets (flowers). The edible part of the plant is the inflorescence, which is composed of small flowers called buds. Each bud consists of several flowers that are encased in a protective bud cover. When the bud is ready to be harvested, its bud cover is removed.

The leaves of lettuce are usually round and smooth-edged, with a crisp texture and a sweet, slightly bitter flavor. They are an excellent source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and dietary fiber. The most common types of lettuce are crisphead (iceberg) lettuce, which has large, crunchy, tightly packed leaves; and leaf lettuce, which has smaller, more delicate leaves.
