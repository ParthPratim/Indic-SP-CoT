He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time. Bach's prolific and wide-ranging output comprises more than 6,000 compositions, including sacred and secular vocal music, choral and orchestral works, and works for solo violin and solo keyboard. Bach wrote both sacred and secular music, including many of the standards of the German and international repertories. He was a proficient player of the viola da gamba, recorder, violin, and clavier (harpsichord), and was an important figure in the development of the piano. His music integrates elements from different musical traditions of his time, including Italian opera and French dance music. He was also greatly admired during his lifetime, and was one of the most influential musicians of the 18th century. The majority of Bach's music is published in standardized editions, making it readily available to performers and audiences today. Bach's influence on music is pervasive and transcends genres; Johann Strauss II's Waltz in A Flat Major is one of his most famous musical descendants.",

He was born in Bonn into a musically active family of teachers; his father was a court musician, and his younger brothers became professional musicians as well. At an early age, he displayed a talent for music that was evident even to his teachers, and his father arranged for him to study with Antonio Salieri, the foremost composer in Vienna. Salieri recognized Beethoven's talent and dedicated his time to teaching the boy, hoping to make a professional musician out of him. In Vienna, the 17-year-old Beethoven was exposed to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Philipp Telemann, and he began to compose his own music. He was profoundly influenced by Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music he came to regard as the pinnacle of perfection. In 1792, Beethoven's father died suddenly and his financial support ended. He was forced to leave Vienna, and he began a period of wandering during which he composed some of his best-known works, including the \"Appassionata\" and \"Waldhorn\" piano sonatas and the \"Missa Solemnis\".",

His most celebrated period was from 1790 to 1805, when he composed his oratorios and operas. He died in Vienna at the age of 77. Haydn's music covers a broad stylistic range. In his early years, he wrote mainly divertimentos, including symphonies, chamber music, and piano sonatas.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time. Bach's prolific and wide-ranging output comprises more than 6,000 compositions, including sacred and secular vocal music, choral and orchestral works, and works for solo violin and solo keyboard. Bach wrote both sacred and secular music, including many of the standards of the German and international repertories. He was a proficient player of the viola da gamba, recorder, violin, and clavier (harpsichord), and was an important figure in the development of the piano. His music integrates elements from different musical traditions of his time, including Italian opera and French dance music. He was also greatly admired during his lifetime, and was one of the most influential musicians of the 18th century. The majority of Bach's music is published in standardized editions, making it readily available to performers and audiences today. Bach's influence on music is pervasive and transcends genres; Johann Strauss II's Waltz in A Flat Major is one of his most famous musical descendants.",
