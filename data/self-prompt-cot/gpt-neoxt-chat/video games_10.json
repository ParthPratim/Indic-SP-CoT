The game is set on a fictionalized New York City called \"Urban Warfare\", in which humans are fighting an extraterrestrial race of alien beings known as the Ceph, who have invaded Earth. The player controls \"Prophet\", a \"Nanosuit\"-wearing soldier who is trying to stop the alien invasion. The Nanosuit is a powered exoskeleton that can enhance the player's speed, strength, and armor, and can be upgraded with \"Nanotrites\" to increase its abilities. The game features a sandbox-like leveling system, where players can use resources found throughout the game to unlock new abilities and purchase items. Crysis received critical acclaim upon release, with praise directed at its visuals and gameplay, but received some criticism for its length and technical issues. The game sold over 2. 7 million copies by March 2011, becoming one of the best-selling first-person shooters. A sequel, Crysis 2, was released in 2011, followed by a prequel, Crysis 3, in 2013. A remastered version of the original game was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in October 2017, and for Xbox One in June 2018.",

The two companies have engaged in numerous legal disputes regarding copyrights, trademarks, and ownership of characters. DC has also been known as \"DC or DC Comics\" to avoid being confused with Marvel, which has also used \"Marvel Comics\" or \"Marvel\" as its name. In the 2000s, the company experienced a decline in sales, but has since experienced success due to the New 52 relaunch, the Rebirth initiative, the DC You initiative and the DC Super Hero Girls franchise.

It is geologically old, about 4.5 billion years, and its slow rotation and oblateness cause it to have a nearly spherical shape. Earth's hydrosphere is the largest of any known planetary body in the Solar System; it has a greater combined mass than that of all the other planets, and contains more than 95% of Earth's known water.
