It lasts for 2–6 years in human beings, and is characterized by the rapid growth of hair follicles from the bulb outward. During the anagen, the dermal papilla cells produce a growth factor, called fibroblast growth factor (FGF), that promotes the proliferation of the matrix cells and the outer root sheath. The matrix cells proliferate rapidly and produce keratin, a structural protein that makes up the hair shaft, which is extruded from the follicle. The anagen phase is followed by catagen, the regression phase, and telogen, the resting phase, during which the hair falls out and the hair follicle shrinks back to the bulb. The human hair growth cycle is approximately three years long, with the anagen phase lasting for two years and the telogen phase lasting for one year.",

The West Indies is a geopolitical term that has been in use since the 16th century. The term is derived from the Old World, where the \"West Indies\" was the common name for the islands of the Lesser Antilles. The West Indies are the second largest and the most populous island group in the Caribbean, after the Greater Antilles. The West Indies is the only island chain in the world to have never had a native population. The West Indies consist of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. The Lesser Antilles consist of the Virgin Islands, the Windward Islands, the Leeward Antilles, the ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao), and the less prominent Bermudian islands. The Greater Antilles are the main island chain, consisting of Cuba, Hispaniola (the Dominican Republic and Haiti), Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad and Tobago. The total land area of the West Indies is approximately, which is less than the combined land area of the United Kingdom. The total population is around 41.5 million people.",
