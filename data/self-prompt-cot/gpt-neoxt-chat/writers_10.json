The family moved when he was nine years old, and he grew up in the South and West, particularly in Hannibal, Missouri, where he became familiar with the river and its characters. He became a proficient and dexterous steamboat pilot, and this experience provided much of the material for his later writing. Twain's father died when he was nine years old, and his mother struggled to raise her five children. Twain quit school after the fourth grade, but he developed a prodigious memory and a lifelong passion for books.

He was one of the most important 20th-century fiction writers in Spanish, and is often grouped together with Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett, and Salman Rushdie as among the major post-war fiction writers of the English language. Borges' prodigious output, which includes more than 70 books and thousands of shorter pieces, made him one of the most widely translated authors in history. Borges began his writing career in the 1920s, publishing poetry, short stories, and essays in Buenos Aires-based journals. He achieved literary fame in the 1940s with the publication of the short story collection Ficciones (1944), which has been called the first modernist masterpiece in Spanish and has had significant influence on Latin American literature.",

At the age of twelve, Clemens left school and became a printer's apprentice, working fourteen-hour days. His father wanted him to become a lawyer, but Clemens instead chose a career in the burgeoning field of journalism. He worked as a printer and typesetter while he studied the craft of writing. At the age of seventeen, Clemens left home and moved to St. Louis, where he worked as a typesetter for the Hannibal Courier, a Democratic Party newspaper.

It is the oldest social fraternity in continuous existence in the United States. The fraternity's founding was inspired by a drinking game called \"the virginals\", which involved a large bowl and a yardstick. The bowl would be passed around the circle, and the yardstick placed across the top. One of the group would then take a drink every time the yardstick was tapped. The bowl and yardstick were later replaced with a bottle and a cane. The latter was used as a reminder of the fraternity's founders, who were all musicians. The fraternity's first chapter was founded at Jefferson College. The fraternity has since expanded to include over 250 chapters at colleges and universities across the United States, as well as a colony at Oxford University. The Phi Kappa Psi fraternity was the first social fraternity to be founded west of the Appalachians, and the first in the United States to be founded on the campus of a small college or university. It was also the first to adopt the Greek-letter name system, which was first used at Jefferson College. The fraternity's founding was inspired by a drinking game called the \"virginals,\" which involved a large bowl and a yardstick.",
