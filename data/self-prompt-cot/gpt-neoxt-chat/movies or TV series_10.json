Saruman is based upon a character of the same name in The Hobbit and The Silmarillion, but Tolkien also developed the character in response to the events of World War I, which he witnessed in person. Saruman's character arc is marked by his fall from grace and redemption. He is initially an ally of Gandalf, but later betrays him and joins Sauron's forces. He is eventually captured by the Rohirrim and imprisoned in Orthanc, where he becomes insane and is imprisoned in a tower. He later escapes and becomes the chief advisor of Isengard. Saruman's role in the books is relatively minor, although he appears in all but the first book. He is the main antagonist of \"The Scouring of the Shire\" and \"The Battle of the Hornburg\" (The Lord of the Rings), and plays a significant role in \"The Treason of Isengard\" and \"The Defeat of the Orcs\".",
